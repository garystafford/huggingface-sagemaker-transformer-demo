{"inputs": "I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."}
{"inputs": "You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth."}
{"inputs": "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."}
{"inputs": "A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you."}
{"inputs": "Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."}
{"inputs": "We accept the love we think we deserve."}
{"inputs": "It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."}
{"inputs": "As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."}
{"inputs": "The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."}
{"inputs": "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."}
{"inputs": "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."}
{"inputs": "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up."}
{"inputs": "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."}
{"inputs": "There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."}
{"inputs": "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."}
{"inputs": "You love me. Real or not real? I tell him, Real."}
{"inputs": "You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there."}
{"inputs": "I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.."}
{"inputs": "I'm in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."}
{"inputs": "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."}
{"inputs": "Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."}
{"inputs": "People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."}
{"inputs": "If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."}
{"inputs": "You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}
{"inputs": "We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."}
{"inputs": "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."}
{"inputs": "The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space."}
{"inputs": "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever."}
{"inputs": "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."}
{"inputs": "When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."}
{"inputs": "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. After all this time? Always, said Snape."}
{"inputs": "I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing."}
{"inputs": "To die will be an awfully big adventure."}
{"inputs": "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."}
{"inputs": "So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."}
{"inputs": "Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can."}
{"inputs": "Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you."}
{"inputs": "The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."}
{"inputs": "Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them, I said. Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway."}
{"inputs": "I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."}
{"inputs": "Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you."}
{"inputs": "When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always."}
{"inputs": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."}
{"inputs": "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving."}
{"inputs": "When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."}
{"inputs": "We love the things we love for what they are."}
{"inputs": "I would die for you. But I won't live for you."}
{"inputs": "In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."}
{"inputs": "You are, and always have been, my dream."}
{"inputs": "You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together."}
{"inputs": "I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is youhere is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)"}
{"inputs": "The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."}
{"inputs": "So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."}
{"inputs": "And now I’m looking at you, he said, and you’re asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before – bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it – but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me."}
{"inputs": "Where there is love there is life."}
{"inputs": "Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary."}
{"inputs": "I would always rather be happy than dignified."}
{"inputs": "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."}
{"inputs": "Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}
{"inputs": "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."}
{"inputs": "The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever"}
{"inputs": "There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."}
{"inputs": "We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."}
{"inputs": "I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."}
{"inputs": "We loved with a love that was more than love."}
{"inputs": "And so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. What a stupid lamb, I sighed. What a sick, masochistic lion."}
{"inputs": "This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something."}
{"inputs": "Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet."}
{"inputs": "I heard what you said. I’m not the silly romantic you think. I don’t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don’t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."}
{"inputs": "A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"}
{"inputs": "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!"}
{"inputs": "Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something."}
{"inputs": "He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."}
{"inputs": "I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear."}
{"inputs": "What's meant to be will always find a way"}
{"inputs": "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love."}
{"inputs": "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing there is a field.I'll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about."}
{"inputs": "Everyone, at some point in their lives, wakes up in the middle of the night with the feeling that they are all alone in the world, and that nobody loves them now and that nobody will ever love them, and that they will never have a decent night's sleep again and will spend their lives wandering blearily around a loveless landscape, hoping desperately that their circumstances will improve, but suspecting, in their heart of hearts, that they will remain unloved forever. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to wake somebody else up, so that they can feel this way, too."}
{"inputs": "They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."}
{"inputs": "Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that's beautiful."}
{"inputs": "No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that's the key. It's like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot."}
{"inputs": "The heart was made to be broken."}
{"inputs": "Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."}
{"inputs": "I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."}
{"inputs": "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."}
{"inputs": "For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."}
{"inputs": "They didn’t agree on much. In fact, they didn’t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."}
{"inputs": "You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me. She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. But I don't want anything else in the world."}
{"inputs": "I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."}
{"inputs": "Love is so short, forgetting is so long."}
{"inputs": "To douchebags! he said, gesturing to Brad. And to girls that break your heart, he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."}
{"inputs": "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."}
{"inputs": "The very essence of romance is uncertainty."}
