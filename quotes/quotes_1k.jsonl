{"inputs": "I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."}
{"inputs": "You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth."}
{"inputs": "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."}
{"inputs": "A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you."}
{"inputs": "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."}
{"inputs": "We accept the love we think we deserve."}
{"inputs": "It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."}
{"inputs": "As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."}
{"inputs": "The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."}
{"inputs": "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."}
{"inputs": "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."}
{"inputs": "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up."}
{"inputs": "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."}
{"inputs": "There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."}
{"inputs": "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."}
{"inputs": "You love me. Real or not real? I tell him, Real."}
{"inputs": "You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there."}
{"inputs": "I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.."}
{"inputs": "I'm in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."}
{"inputs": "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."}
{"inputs": "Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."}
{"inputs": "People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."}
{"inputs": "If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."}
{"inputs": "You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}
{"inputs": "We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."}
{"inputs": "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."}
{"inputs": "The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space."}
{"inputs": "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever."}
{"inputs": "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."}
{"inputs": "When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."}
{"inputs": "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. After all this time? Always, said Snape."}
{"inputs": "I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing."}
{"inputs": "To die will be an awfully big adventure."}
{"inputs": "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."}
{"inputs": "So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."}
{"inputs": "Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can."}
{"inputs": "Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you."}
{"inputs": "The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."}
{"inputs": "Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them, I said. Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway."}
{"inputs": "I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."}
{"inputs": "Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you."}
{"inputs": "When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always."}
{"inputs": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."}
{"inputs": "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving."}
{"inputs": "When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."}
{"inputs": "We love the things we love for what they are."}
{"inputs": "I would die for you. But I won't live for you."}
{"inputs": "In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."}
{"inputs": "You are, and always have been, my dream."}
{"inputs": "You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together."}
{"inputs": "I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is youhere is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)"}
{"inputs": "The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."}
{"inputs": "So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."}
{"inputs": "And now I’m looking at you, he said, and you’re asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before – bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it – but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me."}
{"inputs": "Where there is love there is life."}
{"inputs": "Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary."}
{"inputs": "I would always rather be happy than dignified."}
{"inputs": "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."}
{"inputs": "Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}
{"inputs": "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."}
{"inputs": "The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever"}
{"inputs": "There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."}
{"inputs": "We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."}
{"inputs": "I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."}
{"inputs": "We loved with a love that was more than love."}
{"inputs": "And so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. What a stupid lamb, I sighed. What a sick, masochistic lion."}
{"inputs": "This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something."}
{"inputs": "Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet."}
{"inputs": "I heard what you said. I’m not the silly romantic you think. I don’t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don’t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."}
{"inputs": "A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"}
{"inputs": "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!"}
{"inputs": "Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something."}
{"inputs": "He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."}
{"inputs": "I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear."}
{"inputs": "What's meant to be will always find a way"}
{"inputs": "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love."}
{"inputs": "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing there is a field.I'll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about."}
{"inputs": "Everyone, at some point in their lives, wakes up in the middle of the night with the feeling that they are all alone in the world, and that nobody loves them now and that nobody will ever love them, and that they will never have a decent night's sleep again and will spend their lives wandering blearily around a loveless landscape, hoping desperately that their circumstances will improve, but suspecting, in their heart of hearts, that they will remain unloved forever. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to wake somebody else up, so that they can feel this way, too."}
{"inputs": "They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."}
{"inputs": "Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that's beautiful."}
{"inputs": "No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that's the key. It's like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot."}
{"inputs": "The heart was made to be broken."}
{"inputs": "Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."}
{"inputs": "I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."}
{"inputs": "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."}
{"inputs": "For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."}
{"inputs": "They didn’t agree on much. In fact, they didn’t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."}
{"inputs": "You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me. She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. But I don't want anything else in the world."}
{"inputs": "I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."}
{"inputs": "Love is so short, forgetting is so long."}
{"inputs": "To douchebags! he said, gesturing to Brad. And to girls that break your heart, he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."}
{"inputs": "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."}
{"inputs": "The very essence of romance is uncertainty."}
{"inputs": "What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction."}
{"inputs": "There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."}
{"inputs": "My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away."}
{"inputs": "If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger."}
{"inputs": "Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it."}
{"inputs": "And, in the endThe love you take is equal to the love you make."}
{"inputs": "What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again."}
{"inputs": "It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head."}
{"inputs": "Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction."}
{"inputs": "I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life? ' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did?"}
{"inputs": "If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. Busy is another word for asshole. Asshole is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call."}
{"inputs": "Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell."}
{"inputs": "I have something I need to tell you, he says. I run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him. I might be in love with you. He smiles a little. I'm waiting until I'm sure to tell you, though. That's sensible of you, I say, smiling too. We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something. I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear. Maybe I'm already sure, he says, and I just don't want to frighten you. I laugh a little. Then you should know better. Fine, he says. Then I love you."}
{"inputs": "You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have."}
{"inputs": "I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, 'So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me? ' I turn into him. 'Put you somewhere you can't get hurt."}
{"inputs": "If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets."}
{"inputs": "I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."}
{"inputs": "We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, This is the problem I want to have.I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way."}
{"inputs": "It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new."}
{"inputs": "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."}
{"inputs": "My dear, Find what you love and let it kill you.Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it’s much better to be killed by a lover.~ Falsely yours"}
{"inputs": "If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don't let her go."}
{"inputs": "How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em."}
{"inputs": "If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him."}
{"inputs": "Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong."}
{"inputs": "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."}
{"inputs": "I love you. Remember. They cannot take it"}
{"inputs": "Do you think I'm pretty? I think you're beautifulBeautiful? You are so beautiful, it hurts sometimes."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea."}
{"inputs": "When love is not madness it is not love."}
{"inputs": "Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."}
{"inputs": "A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her."}
{"inputs": "Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited."}
{"inputs": "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."}
{"inputs": "True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning."}
{"inputs": "What's this? he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there. It's a girl, Jace said, recovering his composure. Surely you've seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one."}
{"inputs": "Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."}
{"inputs": "Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired."}
{"inputs": "I was smiling yesterday, I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything."}
{"inputs": "Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."}
{"inputs": "It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done."}
{"inputs": "I love you also means I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else."}
{"inputs": "There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. Is this the moment? Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. OI! There's a war going on here! Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. I know, mate, said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, so it's now or never, isn't it? Never mind that, what about the Horcrux? Harry shouted. D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem? Yeah --- right --- sorry --- said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."}
{"inputs": "If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain."}
{"inputs": "When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace."}
{"inputs": "I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts."}
{"inputs": "It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them."}
{"inputs": "The greater the love, the greater the tragedy when it's over."}
{"inputs": "Hate the sin, love the sinner."}
{"inputs": "Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness."}
{"inputs": "One love, one heart, one destiny."}
{"inputs": "I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be."}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it's these things I'd believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn't all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."}
{"inputs": "If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn't be filled?"}
{"inputs": "It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful."}
{"inputs": "Well, nowIf little by little you stop loving meI shall stop loving youLittle by littleIf suddenly you forget meDo not look for meFor I shall already have forgotten youIf you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my lifeAnd you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have rootsRememberThat on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my armsAnd my roots will set off to seek another land"}
{"inputs": "You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It's not overrated. There's a reason for all those songs."}
{"inputs": "What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul"}
{"inputs": "All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart."}
{"inputs": "To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death."}
{"inputs": "I love you like a fat kid loves cake!"}
{"inputs": "If she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for."}
{"inputs": "It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal."}
{"inputs": "We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved."}
{"inputs": "Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love."}
{"inputs": "We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."}
{"inputs": "They say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same, but I don't think it's possible for you to miss me as much as I'm missing you right now"}
{"inputs": "And when her lips met mine, I knew that I could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world, but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when I first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever."}
{"inputs": "Any fool can be happy. It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep."}
{"inputs": "Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee."}
{"inputs": "You couldn't relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. You had to accept it as a whole--like the world, or the person you loved."}
{"inputs": "What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love."}
{"inputs": "Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart."}
{"inputs": "Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person's ultimate good as far as it can be obtained."}
{"inputs": "The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."}
{"inputs": "Life, he realize, was much like a song. In the beginning there is mystery, in the end there is confirmation, but it's in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile."}
{"inputs": "Find what you love and let it kill you."}
{"inputs": "It’s probably not just by chance that I’m alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he’s terribly strong. And if he’s stronger than I, I’m the one who can’t live with him. … I’m neither smart nor stupid, but I don’t think I’m a run-of-the-mill person. I’ve been in business without being a businesswoman, I’ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men I’ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I’ve done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice."}
{"inputs": "Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being in love , which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident."}
{"inputs": "Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."}
{"inputs": "The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends."}
{"inputs": "Look after my heart - I've left it with you."}
{"inputs": "Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect."}
{"inputs": "One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well."}
{"inputs": "I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary."}
{"inputs": "And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me."}
{"inputs": "He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry."}
{"inputs": "I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."}
{"inputs": "Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time."}
{"inputs": "You can't measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange."}
{"inputs": "Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn’t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes it's a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence."}
{"inputs": "How do you spell 'love'? - Piglet You don't spell it...you feel it. - Pooh"}
{"inputs": "Tonight I can write the saddest linesI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too."}
{"inputs": "I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a savage harvest, hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart, Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue."}
{"inputs": "Happiness is only real when shared"}
{"inputs": "A DEFINITION NOT FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by children"}
{"inputs": "One day you will kiss a man you can't breathe without, and find that breath is of little consequence."}
{"inputs": "Maybe...you'll fall in love with me all over again. Hell, I said, I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me? Yes. I want to ruin you. Good, I said. That's what I want too."}
{"inputs": "Was it hard? I ask.Letting go? Not as hard as holding on to something that wasn't real."}
{"inputs": "I'm saying that I'm a moody, insecure, narrow-minded, jealous, borderline homicidal bitch, and I want you to promise me that you're okay with that, because it's who I am, and you're what I need."}
{"inputs": "Then I realize what it is. It's him. Something about him makes me feel like I am about to fall. Or turn to liquid. Or burst into flames."}
{"inputs": "Art and love are the same thing: It’s the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you."}
{"inputs": "Letting go doesn't mean that you don't care about someone anymore. It's just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself."}
{"inputs": "As if you were on fire from within.The moon lives in the lining of your skin."}
{"inputs": "The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them"}
{"inputs": "Promise me you'll never forget me because if I thought you would, I'd never leave."}
{"inputs": "Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who's in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It's like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven't seen in a long time."}
{"inputs": "I could not tell you if I loved you the first moment I saw you, or if it was the second or third or fourth. But I remember the first moment I looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you."}
{"inputs": "I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity."}
{"inputs": "When I am with you, we stay up all night.When you're not here, I can't go to sleep.Praise God for those two insomnias! And the difference between them."}
{"inputs": "I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of."}
{"inputs": "You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection"}
{"inputs": "Tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness. They are a sign of a pure heart."}
{"inputs": "The saddest people I've ever met in life are the ones who don't care deeply about anything at all. Passion and satisfaction go hand in hand, and without them, any happiness is only temporary, because there's nothing to make it last."}
{"inputs": "She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers...She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on..."}
{"inputs": "If conversation was the lyrics, laughter was the music, making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale."}
{"inputs": "You could have fooled me. Everytime I called you, Luke said you were sick. I figured you were avoiding me. Again. I wasn't. I did want to talk to you. I've been thinking about you all the time. I've been thinking about you, too. I really was sick. I swear. I almost died back there on the ship, you know. I know. Everytime you almost die, I almost die myself."}
{"inputs": "We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and—in spite of True Romance magazines—we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely—at least, not all the time—but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."}
{"inputs": "It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me."}
{"inputs": "In time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go. At least I thought it was. But in every boy I met in the next few years, I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong, I'd write you another letter. But I never sent them for fear of what I might find. By then, you'd gone on with your life and I didn't want to think about you loving someone else. I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. I didn't ever want to lose that."}
{"inputs": "There is only one page left to write on. I will fill it with words of only one syllable. I love. I have loved. I will love."}
{"inputs": "Happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago.Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything."}
{"inputs": "A half-read book is a half-finished love affair."}
{"inputs": "To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."}
{"inputs": "I like flaws. I think they make things interesting."}
{"inputs": "Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."}
{"inputs": "I'm oxygen and he's dying to breathe."}
{"inputs": "Who, being loved, is poor?"}
{"inputs": "Lost love is still love. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it."}
{"inputs": "I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand & the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep & there are no words for that."}
{"inputs": "Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another."}
{"inputs": "I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won't."}
{"inputs": "I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia."}
{"inputs": "Peeta, how come I never know when you're having a nightmare? I say.I don't know. I don't think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror, he says.You should wake me, I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.It's not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you, he says. I'm okay once I realize you're here."}
{"inputs": "A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."}
{"inputs": "It is easy to love people in memory the hard thing is to love them when they are there in front of you."}
{"inputs": "The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come."}
{"inputs": "Love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby- awkwardly, and often with a great deal of mess."}
{"inputs": "When I saw you I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew."}
{"inputs": "You know how they say you only hurt the ones you love? Well, it works both ways."}
{"inputs": "Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I can not live without my life! I can not live without my soul!"}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with her when we were together, then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart."}
{"inputs": "What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst."}
{"inputs": "I know we're fucked up, alright? I'm impulsive, and hot tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else. You act like you hate me one minute, and then need me the next. I never get anything right, and I don't deserve you...but I fucking love you, Abby. I love you more than I loved anyone or anything ever. When you're around, I don't need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands..."}
{"inputs": "Sorrow is how we learn to love. Your heart isn't breaking. It hurts because it's getting larger. The larger it gets, the more love it holds."}
{"inputs": "Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing."}
{"inputs": "One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life:That word is love."}
{"inputs": "Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those."}
{"inputs": "Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be."}
{"inputs": "It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know. We all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and, giving out nothing, receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death."}
{"inputs": "I guess that’s just part of loving people: You have to give things up. Sometimes you even have to give them up."}
{"inputs": "I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face, I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine."}
{"inputs": "The more one judges, the less one loves."}
{"inputs": "The heart has its reasons which reason knows not."}
{"inputs": "The emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it..."}
{"inputs": "Time was passing like a hand waving from a train I wanted to be on. I hope you never have to think about anything as much as I think about you."}
{"inputs": "Do not fall in love with people like me. I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments, and kiss you in every beautiful place, so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth.I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible. And when I leave you will finally understand, why storms are named after people."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes love means letting go when you want to hold on tighter."}
{"inputs": "Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive."}
{"inputs": "Trust your heart if the seas catch fire, live by love though the stars walk backward."}
{"inputs": "The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books"}
{"inputs": "If someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody I love, I would eat them. I might end up in jail for 500 years, but I would eat them."}
{"inputs": "From childhood's hour I have not been. As others were, I have not seen. As others saw, I could not awaken. My heart to joy at the same tone. And all I loved, I loved alone."}
{"inputs": "Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us."}
{"inputs": "People have forgotten this truth, the fox said. But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose."}
{"inputs": "If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that, too. I was talking to Liz and she said maybe coming back to your old life would be too painful, that maybe it'd be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I'd do it. I can lose you like that if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay."}
{"inputs": "Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love."}
{"inputs": "When someone is in your heart, they're never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times."}
{"inputs": "Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation."}
{"inputs": "Don't cry over someone who wouldn't cry over you."}
{"inputs": "Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire."}
{"inputs": "Being with you never felt wrong. It's the one thing I did right. You're the one thing I did right."}
{"inputs": "I wonder how many people don't get the one they want, but end up with the one they're supposed to be with."}
{"inputs": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach"}
{"inputs": "When you trip over love, it is easy to get up. But when you fall in love, it is impossible to stand again."}
{"inputs": "This is where it all begins. Everything starts here, today."}
{"inputs": "to love life, to love it even when you have no stomach for it and everything you've held dear crumbles like burnt paper in your hands, your throat filled with the silt of it.When grief sits with you, its tropical heatthickening the air, heavy as watermore fit for gills than lungs;when grief weights you like your own fleshonly more of it, an obesity of grief, you think, How can a body withstand this? Then you hold life like a facebetween your palms, a plain face, no charming smile, no violet eyes, and you say, yes, I will take youI will love you, again."}
{"inputs": "Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it's an impossibility, but I cannot help myself."}
{"inputs": "To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous."}
{"inputs": "I’ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. What’s the point of being who I am, if I can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for?"}
{"inputs": "I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me."}
{"inputs": "In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art."}
{"inputs": "The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only."}
{"inputs": "True love is usually the most inconvenient kind."}
{"inputs": "You’ll get over it… It’s the clichés that cause the trouble. To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever. You don’t get over it because ‘it is the person you loved. The pain stops, there are new people, but the gap never closes. How could it? The particularness of someone who mattered enough to grieve over is not made anodyne by death. This hole in my heart is in the shape of you and no-one else can fit it. Why would I want them to?"}
{"inputs": "Watch out for intellect, because it knows so much it knows nothing and leaves you hanging upside down, mouthing knowledge as your heart falls out of your mouth."}
{"inputs": "We're staying together, he promised. You're not getting away from me. Never again."}
{"inputs": "The sunlight claps the earth, and the moonbeams kiss the sea: what are all these kissings worth, if thou kiss not me?"}
{"inputs": "Even After All this timeThe Sun never says to the Earth, You owe me. LookWhat happensWith a love like that, It lights the whole sky."}
{"inputs": "When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed."}
{"inputs": "To lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a balanced life."}
{"inputs": "You know it's never fifty-fifty in a marriage. It's always seventy-thirty, or sixty-forty. Someone falls in love first. Someone puts someone else up on a pedestal. Someone works very hard to keep things rolling smoothly; someone else sails along for the ride."}
{"inputs": "If you love something set it free, but don't be surprised if it comes back with herpes."}
{"inputs": "My wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness."}
{"inputs": "The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember that."}
{"inputs": "Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country."}
{"inputs": "I sought to hear the voice of God and climbed the topmost steeple, but God declared: Go down again - I dwell among the people."}
{"inputs": "The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine."}
{"inputs": "If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."}
{"inputs": "sometimes you don't need a goal in life, you don't need to know the big picture. you just need to know what you're going to do next!"}
{"inputs": "We are who we are, because of those we choose to love and because of those who love us."}
{"inputs": "I won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me."}
{"inputs": "This is what we call love. When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are loved, secretly, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn't live boldly enough, that they didn't invest enough heart, didn't love enough. Nothing else really counts at all."}
{"inputs": "We are not trapped or locked up in these bones. No, no. We are free to change. And love changes us. And if we can love one another, we can break open the sky."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena."}
{"inputs": "Ok. You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole. Is this a pretty accurate description of our relationship."}
{"inputs": "You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince"}
{"inputs": "I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word busy is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want."}
{"inputs": "About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all."}
{"inputs": "For my part, I prefer my heart to be broken. It is so lovely, dawn-kaleidoscopic within the crack."}
{"inputs": "The world was collapsing, and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive."}
{"inputs": "When I look in the mirror, I know I’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all."}
{"inputs": "I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it -- to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just once."}
{"inputs": "The course of true love never did run smooth."}
{"inputs": "Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze."}
{"inputs": "If there is no love in the world, we will make a new world, and we will give it walls, and we will furnish it with soft, red interiors, from the inside out, and give it a knocker that resonates like a diamond falling to a jeweller's felt so that we should never hear it. Love me, because love doesn't exist, and I have tried everything that does."}
{"inputs": "In a perfect world, you could fuck people without giving them a piece of your heart. And every glittering kiss and every touch of flesh is another shard of heart you’ll never see again."}
{"inputs": "The human heart is a strange vessel. Love and hatred can exist side by side."}
{"inputs": "For where all love is, the speaking is unnecessary"}
{"inputs": "Someday you're gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving. You'll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken, but your life was changing..."}
{"inputs": "When we meet someone and fall in love, we have a sense that the whole universe is on our side. And yet if something goes wrong, there is nothing left! How is it possible for the beauty that was there only minutes before to vanish so quickly? Life moves very fast. It rushes from heaven to hell in a matter of seconds."}
{"inputs": "Spending time with you showed me what I’ve been missing in my life."}
{"inputs": "In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them."}
{"inputs": "sex is the consolation you have when you can't have love"}

Deny thy father refuse thy name, thou art thyself thou not a montegue, what is montegue? tis nor hand nor foot nor any other part belonging to a man What is in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, So Romeo would were he not Romeo called retain such dear perfection to which he owes without that title, Romeo, Doth thy name! And for that name which is no part of thee, take all thyself."}
{"inputs": "Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew - knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest - was how love gave someone the power to break you"}

{"inputs": "I know that's what people say-- you'll get over it. I'd say it, too. But I know it's not true. Oh, you'll be happy again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him."}
{"inputs": "Love is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. If love were only a feeling, there would be no basis for the promise to love each other forever. A feeling comes and it may go. How can I judge that it will stay forever, when my act does not involve judgment and decision."}
{"inputs": "But love is always new. Regardless of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always face a brand-new situation. Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere. We simply have to accept it, because it is what nourishes our existence. If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. We have to take love where we find it, even if that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness.The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us. And to save us."}

{"inputs": "I'd learned that some things are best kept secret."}
{"inputs": "You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won’t tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you’ve done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you’re tired. You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying to choke down the feeling, and you’re trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you’ve discovered something you didn’t even have a name for."}
{"inputs": "Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it."}
{"inputs": "And next time you're planning to injure yourself to get me attention, just remember that a little sweet talk works wonders."}
{"inputs": "I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend. The one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them. I want to know every curve, every freckle, every shiver of your body. I want to know where to touch you, I want to know how to touch you. I want to know convince you to design a smile just for me. Yes, I do want to be your friend. I want to be your best friend in the entire world."}
{"inputs": "Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone."}
{"inputs": "If only she could be so oblivious again, to feel such love without knowing it, mistaking it for laughter."}
{"inputs": "I am not an angel, I asserted; and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate."}
{"inputs": "love, I've come to understand is more than three words mumbled before bedtime."}
{"inputs": "It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving."}
{"inputs": "The highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being."}
{"inputs": "I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother."}
{"inputs": "We are told that people stay in love because of chemistry, or because they remain intrigued with each other, because of many kindnesses, because of luck. But part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness."}
{"inputs": "NO. No no no. I don't want to screw you. I just love you. When did who you want to screw become the whole game? Since when is the person you want to screw the only person you get to love? It's so stupid, Tiny! I mean, Jesus, who even gives a fuck about sex? ! People act like it's the most important thing humans do, but come on. How can our sentient fucking lives revolve around something slugs can do. I mean, who you want to screw and whether you screw them? Those are important questions, I guess. But they're not that important. You know what's important? Who would you die for? Who do you wake up at five forty-five in the morning for even though you don't even know why he needs you? Whose drunken nose would you pick? !"}
{"inputs": "And what would humans be without love? RARE, said Death."}
{"inputs": "Of course you can have a true Shadowhunter name, Will said. You can have mine. Tessa stared at him, all black and white against the black-and-white snow and stone. Your name? Will took a step toward her, till they stood face-to-face. Then he reached to take her hand and slid off her glove, which he put into his pocket. He held her bare hand in his, his fingers curved around hers. His hand was warm and callused, and his touch made her shiver. His eyes were steady and blue; they were everything that Will was: true and tender, sharp and witty, loving and kind. Marry me, he said. Marry me, Tess. Marry me and be called Tessa Herondale. Or be Tessa Gray, or be whatever you wish to call yourself, but marry me and stay with me and never leave me, for I cannot bear another day of my life to go by that does not have you in it."}
{"inputs": "I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent."}
{"inputs": "Afterward, I had the last laugh. I made an air bubble at the bottom of the lake. Our friends kept waiting for us to come up, but hey-when you are the son of Poseidon, you don't have to hurry. And it was pretty much the best underwater kiss of all time."}
{"inputs": "Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart"}
{"inputs": "True love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the well-being of one's companion."}
{"inputs": "Hearts are breakable, Isabelle said. And I think even when you heal, you're never what you were before ."}
{"inputs": "Just because you're beautiful and perfect, it's made you conceited."}

{"inputs": "By the time you swear you're his, Shivering and sighing.And he vows his passion is, Infinite, undying.Lady make note of this --One of you is lying."}
{"inputs": "Anxiety is love's greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic."}
{"inputs": "I'll fight it. I'll fight it for you. Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'm okay. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time."}
{"inputs": "That's what people do who love you. They put their arms around you and love you when you're not so lovable."}
{"inputs": "Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love."}
{"inputs": "The heart is the toughest part of the body. Tenderness is in the hands."}
{"inputs": "Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow."}
{"inputs": "She was my dream. She made me who I am, and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat. I think about her all the time. Even now, when I'm sitting here, I think about her. There could never have been another."}
{"inputs": "The soul is healed by being with children."}
{"inputs": "People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility."}
{"inputs": "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get - only with what you are expecting to give - which is everything"}
{"inputs": "I wondered what happened when you offered yourself to someone, and they opened you, only to discover you were not the gift they expected and they had to smile and nod and say thank you all the same."}
{"inputs": "When it's gone, you'll know what a gift love was. You'll suffer like this. So go back and fight to keep it."}
{"inputs": "Romance is thinking about your significant other, when you are supposed to be thinking about something else."}
{"inputs": "If you're a bird... I'm a bird..."}
{"inputs": "I told you. You don't love someone because of their looks or their clothes or their car. You love them because they sing a song only your heart can understand."}
{"inputs": "True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."}
{"inputs": "The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day."}
{"inputs": "Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. You said I killed you--haunt me then. The murdered do haunt their murderers. I believe--I know that ghosts have wandered the earth. Be with me always--take any form--drive me mad. Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! It is unutterable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!"}
{"inputs": "If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's salvation in life. Even if you can't get together with that person."}
{"inputs": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! - I have as much soul as you, - and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you!"}
{"inputs": "In youth, it was a way I had, To do my best to please.And change, with every passing ladTo suit his theories.But now I know the things I knowAnd do the things I do, And if you do not like me so, To hell, my love, with you."}
{"inputs": "I was blind and heart broken and didn't want to do anything and Gus burst into my room and shouted, I have wonderful news! And I was like, I don't really want to hear wonderful news right now, and Gus said, This is wonderful news you want to hear, and I asked him, Fine, what is it? and he said, You are going to live a good and long life filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even imagine yet!"}
{"inputs": "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring barque, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved."}
{"inputs": "You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."}
{"inputs": "Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real."}
{"inputs": "I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine."}
{"inputs": "Well? Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. How was it? Harry considered it for a moment. Wet, he said truthfully.Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell. Because she was crying, Harry continued heavily. Oh, said Ron, his smile faded slightly. Are you that bad at kissing? Dunno, said Harry, who hadn't considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. Maybe I am."}
{"inputs": "Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another? We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close can we come to that person's essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?"}
{"inputs": "Someday you'll find someone special again. People who've been in love once usually do. It's in their nature."}
{"inputs": "Yours is the light by which my spirit's born: - you are my sun, my moon, and all my stars."}
{"inputs": "It's bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different. They're not. They're just variations of the same love. Variations of the same desire to be close."}
{"inputs": "If my love were an ocean, there would be no more land.If my love were a desert, you would see only sand.If my love were a star-late at night, only light.And if my love could grow wings, I'd be soaring in flight."}
{"inputs": "Love, it never dies. It never goes away, it never fades, so long as you hang on to it. Love can make you immortal"}
{"inputs": "I've been in love before, it's like a narcotic. At first it brings the euphoria of complete surrender. The next day you want more. You're not addicted yet, but you like the sensation, and you think you can still control things.You think about the person you love for two minutes then forget them for three hours. But then you get used to that person, and you begin to be completely dependent on them. Now you think about him for three hours and forget him for two minutes. If he's not there, you feel like an addict who can't get a fix. And just as addicts steal and humiliate themselves to get what they need, you're willing to do anything for love. - By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept"}
{"inputs": "It's hard being left behind. It's hard to be the one who stays."}
{"inputs": "Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman)."}
{"inputs": "Why are old lovers able to become friends? Two reasons. They never truly loved each other, or they love each other still."}
{"inputs": "and he suddenly knew that if she killed herself, he would die. Maybe not immediately, maybe not with the same blinding rush of pain, but it would happen. You couldn't live for very long without a heart."}
{"inputs": "She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second."}
{"inputs": "I think I fell in love with her, a little bit. Isn't that dumb? But it was like I knew her. Like she was my oldest, dearest friend. The kind of person you can tell anything to, no matter how bad, and they'll still love you, because they know you. I wanted to go with her. I wanted her to notice me. And then she stopped walking. Under the moon, she stopped. And looked at us. She looked at me. Maybe she was trying to tell me something; I don't know. She probably didn't even know I was there. But I'll always love her. All my life."}
{"inputs": "Moments, when lost, can't be found again. They're just gone."}
{"inputs": "here she is, all mine, trying her best to give me all she can. How could I ever hurt her? But I didn’t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair."}
{"inputs": "I like not only to be loved, but also to be told that I am loved. I am not sure that you are of the same mind. But the realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave. This is the world of light and speech, and I shall take leave to tell you that you are very dear."}
{"inputs": "What are the chances you’d ever meet someone like that? he wondered. Someone you could love forever, someone who would forever love you back? And what did you do when that person was born half a world away? The math seemed impossible."}
{"inputs": "That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. Most people love you for who you pretend to be. To keep their love, you keep pretending - performing. You get to love your pretence. It's true, we're locked in an image, an act - and the sad thing is, people get so used to their image, they grow attached to their masks. They love their chains. They forget all about who they really are. And if you try to remind them, they hate you for it, they feel like you're trying to steal their most precious possession."}
{"inputs": "I wonder if fears ever really go away, or if they just lose their power over us."}
{"inputs": "In desperate love, we always invent the characters of our partners, demanding they be what we need of them, and then feeling devastated when they refuse to perform the role we created in the first place."}
{"inputs": "Trust no friend without faults, and love a woman, but no angel."}
{"inputs": "There is always something left to love."}
{"inputs": "We must love one another or die"}
{"inputs": "It happens like this. One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel more connected to this stranger than anyone else--closer to them than your closest family. Perhaps this person carries within them an angel--one sent to you for some higher purpose; to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe during a perilous time. What you must do is trust in them--even if they come hand in hand with pain or suffering--the reason for their presence will become clear in due time. Though here is a word of warning--you may grow to love this person but remember they are not yours to keep. Their purpose isn't to save you but to show you how to save yourself. And once this is fulfilled; the halo lifts and the angel leaves their body as the person exits your life. They will be a stranger to you once more.-------------------------------------------------It's so dark right now, I can't see any light around me. That's because the light is coming from you. You can't see it but everyone else can."}
{"inputs": "You say you love rain, but you use an umbrella to walk under it. You say you love sun, but you seek shelter when it is shining. You say you love wind, but when it comes you close your windows. So that's why I'm scared when you say you love me."}
{"inputs": "If a thing loves, it is infinite."}
{"inputs": "I'm lonely. Why do you think I had to learn to act so independent? I also get mad too quickly, and I hog the covers, and my second toe is longer than my big one. My hair has it's own zip code. Plus, I get certifiably crazy when I've got PMS. You don't love someone because they're perfect. You love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}

{"inputs": "You are like nobody since I love you."}
{"inputs": "He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs."}

{"inputs": "Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for them to be hurt."}
{"inputs": "The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved -- loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves."}
{"inputs": "She didn't understand that. How can anyone be afraid of love? How can they not? His face was completely aghast. When you love someone... truly love them, friend or lover, you lay your heart open to them. You give them a part of yourself that you give to no one else, and you let them inside a part of you that only they can hurt—you literally hand them the razor with a map of where to cut deepest and most painfully on your heart and soul. And when they do strike, it's crippling—like having your heart carved out. It leaves you naked and exposed, wondering what you did to make them want to hurt you so badly when all you did was love them. What is so wrong with you that no one can keep faith with you? That no one can love you? To have it happen once is bad enough... but to have it repeated? Who in their right mind would not be terrified of that?"}
{"inputs": "Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. Love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves it's own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever."}
{"inputs": "No matter how much you think you love somebody, you'll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close."}
{"inputs": "Of course I’ll hurt you. Of course you’ll hurt me. Of course we will hurt each other. But this is the very condition of existence. To become spring, means accepting the risk of winter. To become presence, means accepting the risk of absence."}
{"inputs": "They say a good love is one that sits you down, gives you a drink of water, and pats you on top of the head. But I say a good love is one that casts you into the wind, sets you ablaze, makes you burn through the skies and ignite the night like a phoenix; the kind that cuts you loose like a wildfire and you can't stop running simply because you keep on burning everything that you touch! I say that's a good love; one that burns and flies, and you run with it!"}
{"inputs": "He made a sound like a choked laughed before he reached out and pulled her into her arms. She was aware of Luke watching them from the window, but she shut her eyes resolutely and buried her face against Jace's shoulder. He smelled of salt and blood, and only when his mouth came close to her ear did she understand what he was saying, and it was the simplest litany of all: her name, just her name."}
{"inputs": "People always fall in love with the most perfect aspects of each other’s personalities. Who wouldn’t? Anybody can love the most wonderful parts of another person. But that’s not the clever trick. The really clever trick is this: Can you accept the flaws? Can you look at your partner’s faults honestly and say, ‘I can work around that. I can make something out of it.’? Because the good stuff is always going to be there, and it’s always going to pretty and sparkly, but the crap underneath can ruin you."}
{"inputs": "Happily ever after, or even just together ever after, is not cheesy, Wren said. It’s the noblest, like, the most courageous thing two people can shoot for."}
{"inputs": "No, Dimitri interrupted gently. He moved his face toward mine, our foreheads nearly touching. It won't happen to you. You're too strong. You'll fight it, just like you did thistime. I only did because you were here. He wrapped his arms around me, and I buried my face in his chest. I can't do it by myself, I whispered. You can, he said. There was a tremulous note in his voice. You're strong—you're so, so strong. It's why I love you."}
{"inputs": "What greater gift than the love of a cat."}
{"inputs": "We are all worthy of one another."}
{"inputs": "Love is an abstract noun, something nebulous. And yet love turns out to be the only part of us that is solid, as the world turns upside down and the screen goes black."}
{"inputs": "If someone thinks that peace and love are just a cliche that must have been left behind in the 60s, that's a problem. Peace and love are eternal."}
{"inputs": "Love cannot be reduced to a catalogue of reasons why, and a catalogue of reasons cannot be put together into love."}
{"inputs": "The fate of your heart is your choice and no one else gets a vote"}

{"inputs": "You two are too cute, the counter girl said, setting two cups piled with whipped cream on the counter. She had a sort of lopsided, open smile that made me think she laughed a lot. Seriously. How long have you been going out? Sam let go of my hands to get his wallet and took out some bills. Six years.I wrinkled my nose to cover a laugh. Of course he would count the time that we’d been two entirely different species.Whoa. Counter girl nodded appreciatively. That’s pretty amazing for a couple your age. Sam handed me my hot chocolate and didn’t answer. But his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively—I wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be.I crouched to look at the almond bark on the bottom shelf in the counter. I wasn’t quite bold enough to look at either of them when I admitted, Well, it was love at first sight.The girl sighed. That is just so romantic. Do me a favor, and don’t you two ever change. The world needs more love at first sight."}
{"inputs": "The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you."}
{"inputs": "You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose."}
{"inputs": "To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect."}
{"inputs": "Lovers alone wear sunlight."}
{"inputs": "Oh no. Don't smile. You'll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile."}
{"inputs": "Real isn't how you are made, ' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.''Does it hurt? ' asked the Rabbit. 'Sometimes, ' said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. 'When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.' 'Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, ' he asked, 'or bit by bit? ' 'It doesn't happen all at once, ' said the Skin Horse. 'You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."}
{"inputs": "The greatest disease in the West today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. The poverty in the West is a different kind of poverty -- it is not only a poverty of loneliness but also of spirituality. There's a hunger for love, as there is a hunger for God."}
{"inputs": "Because, if you could love someone, and keep loving them, without being loved back . . . then that love had to be real. It hurt too much to be anything else."}

{"inputs": "Do I love you? My God, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches."}

{"inputs": "I don't want to lose you.' His voice almost a whisper. Seeing his haggard expression, she took his hand and squeezed it, then reluctantly let it go. She could feel the tears again, and she fought them back. 'But you don't want to keep me, either, do you? ' To that, he had no response."}
{"inputs": "If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you."}
{"inputs": "I think we ought to live happily ever after."}
{"inputs": "Unless you love someone, nothing else makes sense."}
{"inputs": "I want morning and noon and nightfall with you. I want your tears, your smiles, your kisses...the smell of your hair, the taste of your skin, the touch of your breath on my face. I want to see you in the final hour of my life...to lie in your arms as I take my last breath."}

{"inputs": "Hiding how you really feel and trying to make everyone happy doesn't make you nice, it just makes you a liar."}
{"inputs": "Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."}
{"inputs": "It's so curious: one can resist tears and 'behave' very well in the hardest hours of grief. But then someone makes you a friendly sign behind a window, or one notices that a flower that was in bud only yesterday has suddenly blossomed, or a letter slips from a drawer... and everything collapses."}
{"inputs": "You're like a song that I heard when I was a little kid but forgot I knew until I heard it again."}
{"inputs": "I will find you, he whispered in my ear. I promise. If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you - then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes. For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust. But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance. When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest. His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God! I loved her well."}
{"inputs": "If I were to live a thousand years, I would belong to you for all of them. If we were to live a thousand lives, I would want to make you mine in each one."}
{"inputs": "I don’t know what they are called, the spaces between seconds – but I think of you always in those intervals."}
{"inputs": "Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."}
{"inputs": "Love sucks. Sometimes it feels good. Sometimes it's just another way to bleed."}
{"inputs": "I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me."}
{"inputs": "To him she seemed so beautiful, so seductive, so different from ordinary people, that he could not understand why no one was as disturbed as he by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones, why no one else's heart was wild with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils, why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid, the flight of her hands, the gold of her laughter. He had not missed a single one of her gestures, not one of the indications of her character, but he did not dare approach her for fear of destroying the spell."}

I live with painThat is like a wound; if you touch me, you willMake to me an irreperable harm.Your caresses enfold me, like climbingVines on melancholy walls.I have forgotten your love, yet I seem toGlimpse you in every window.Because of you, the heady perfumes ofSummer pain me; because of you, I againSeek out the signs that precipitate desires:Shooting stars, falling objects."}

{"inputs": "Perhaps, after all, romance did not come into one’s life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down; perhaps it crept to one’s side like an old friend through quiet ways; perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music, perhaps . . . perhaps . . . love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath."}
{"inputs": "You really love her don't you, she said.With all my heart. She looked as sad as I'd ever seen her.What's your heart telling you to do? I don't know. Maybe , she said gently, You're trying to hard to hear it."}
{"inputs": "You have a... remarkable memory. I remember everything about you. You're the one who wasn't paying attention."}
{"inputs": "We always see our worst selves. Our most vulnerable selves. We need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong. Someone we trust."}
{"inputs": "Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if oyu planned on fallin gin love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "The moment you stop to think about whether you love someone, you've already stopped loving that person forever."}

{"inputs": "The day the power of love overrules the love of power, the world will know peace."}
{"inputs": "Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or--such is the pleasure they experience--they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them."}
{"inputs": "Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.Good things come to those who wait."}
{"inputs": "Love is the ultimate outlaw. It just won't adhere to any rules. The most any of us can do is to sign on as its accomplice. Instead of vowing to honor and obey, maybe we should swear to aid and abet. That would mean that security is out of the question. The words make and stay become inappropriate. My love for you has no strings attached. I love you for free."}
{"inputs": "My mother... she is beautiful, softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel. I want to grow old and be like her."}
{"inputs": "I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being."}
{"inputs": "Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it."}
{"inputs": "We're all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness — and call it love — true love."}
{"inputs": "We could do it, you know. What? Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it."}
{"inputs": "It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love."}
{"inputs": "My sister will die over and over again for the rest of my life. Grief is forever. It doesn't go away; it becomes a part of you, step for step, breath for breath. I will never stop grieving Bailey because I will never stop loving her. That's just how it is. Grief and love are conjoined, you don't get one without the other. All I can do is love her, and love the world, emulate her by living with daring and spirit and joy."}
{"inputs": "This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible. And when it’s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be."}
{"inputs": "Parents were the only ones obligated to love you from the rest of the world you had to earn it."}
{"inputs": "Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved."}

{"inputs": "Have you ever lost yourself in a kiss? I mean pure psychedelic inebriation. Not just lustful petting but transcendental metamorphosis when you became aware that the greatness of this being was breathing into you. Licking the sides and corners of your mouth, like sealing a thousand fleshy envelopes filled with the essence of your passionate being and then opened by the same mouth and delivered back to you, over and over again - the first kiss of the rest of your life. A kiss that confirms that the universe is aligned, that the world's greatest resource is love, and maybe even that God is a woman. With or without a belief in God, all kisses are metaphors decipherable by allocations of time, circumstance, and understanding"}

{"inputs": "And it came to me then. That we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits. From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment. In the next instant we'd be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up and became nothing."}
{"inputs": "What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate, and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone's jokes? Was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back? Was it knowing someone so well that they instantly understood why you did the things you did—and shared those same beliefs?"}

One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky. She's drunk, Joe Bell informed me. Moderately, Holly confessed....Holly lifted her martini. Let's wish the Doc luck, too, she said, touching her glass against mine. Good luck: and believe me, dearest Doc -- it's better to look at the sky than live there. Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes and things disappear."}

He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you were my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out. He'll try and get me through you. What if I don't care? I care. How do you think I'd feel if this was your funeral...and it was my fault..."}

{"inputs": "One thing I do know about intimacy is that there are certain natural laws which govern the sexual experience of two people, and that these laws cannot be budged any more than gravity can be negotiated with. To feel physically comfortable with someone else's body is not a decision you can make. It has very little to do with how two people think or act or talk or even look. The mysterious magnet is either there, buried somewhere deep behind the sternum, or it is not. When it isn't there (as I have learned in the past, with heartbreaking clarity) you can no more force it to exist than a surgeon can force a patient's body to accept a kidney from the wrong donor. My friend Annie says it all comes down to one simple question: Do you want your belly pressed against this person's belly forever --or not?"}

{"inputs": "How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode."}
{"inputs": "We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare."}
{"inputs": "Let us begin this letter, this prelude to an encounter, formally, as a declaration, in the old-fashioned way: I love you. You do not know me (although you have seen me, smiled at me). I know you (although not so well as I would like. I want to be there when your eyes flutter open in the morning, and you see me, and you smile. Surely this would be paradise enough? ). So I do declare myself to you now, with pen set to paper. I declare it again: I love you."}

How can you say you love one person when there are ten thousand people in the world that you would love more if you ever met them? But you'll never meet them. All right, so we do the best we can. Granted. But we must still realize that love is just the result of a chance encounter. Most people make too much of it. On these grounds a good fuck is not to be entirely scorned. But that's the result of a chance meeting too. You're damned right. Drink up. We'll have another."}

What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will did it. I have no broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - Oh, God! would you like to lie with your soul in the grave?"}

You can't. He was sitting up now, leaning forward. I can't. I know. They never let you be famous AND happy. He lifted an eyebrow. I'll tell you a secret. Tell me. I loved it when he was like this. I'm going to be the first. He took my palm and held it to his. Swear it. Why me? Because you're the reason. Swear it. I swear it, I said, lost in the high color of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes. I swear it, he echoed.We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned. I feel like I could eat the world raw."}
{"inputs": "Now very much against her will, she thought of the way Jace had looked at her then, the blaze of faith in his eyes, his belief in her. He had always thought she was strong. He had showed it in everything he did, in every look and every touch. Simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. But Jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was."}

{"inputs": "If you want some advice—which I'm sure you don't—you guys should lay off on the magic. Christian still thinks you're moving in on Lissa. What? he asked in mock astonishment. Doesn't he know my heart belongs to you? It does not. And no, he's still worried about it, despite what I've told him. You know, I bet if we started making out right now, it would make him feel better. If you touch me, I said pleasantly, I'll provide you with the opportunity to see if you can heal yourself. Then we'd see how badass you really are."}

{"inputs": "Here's something else to think about: calling when you say you're going to is the very first brick in the house you are building of love and trust. If he can't lay this one stupid brick down, you ain't never gonna have a house baby, and it's cold outside."}
{"inputs": "When you love someone you let them take care of you."}
{"inputs": "I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you."}

{"inputs": "When You Are Old WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true, But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face; And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars."}
{"inputs": "After all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn't bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it's a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it's sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we're doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony."}
{"inputs": "One day, when I am a braver man, I will tell her these things, and then I will look her in the eye tell her I love her and ask her to be only mine. But until that day, we're just friends."}
{"inputs": "This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet."}

{"inputs": "I dreamed I spoke in another's language, I dreamed I lived in another's skin, I dreamed I was my own beloved, I dreamed I was a tiger's kin.I dreamed that Eden lived inside me, And when I breathed a garden came, I dreamed I knew all of Creation, I dreamed I knew the Creator's name.I dreamed--and this dream was the finest--That all I dreamed was real and true, And we would live in joy forever, You in me, and me in you."}
{"inputs": "The strongest love is the love that can demonstrate its fragility."}
{"inputs": "Eventually something you love is going to be taken away. And then you will fall to the floor crying. And then, however much later, it is finally happening to you: you’re falling to the floor crying thinking, I am falling to the floor crying, but there’s an element of the ridiculous to it — you knew it would happen and, even worse, while you’re on the floor crying you look at the place where the wall meets the floor and you realize you didn’t paint it very well."}

{"inputs": "nothing in this world was more difficult than love."}
{"inputs": "...unrequited love does not die; it's only beaten down to a secret place where it hides, curled and wounded. For some unfortunates, it turns bitter and mean, and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before."}
{"inputs": "There is no pretending , Jace said with absolute clarity. I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there's a life after that, I'll love you then. She caught her breath.He had said it-the words there was no going back from."}
{"inputs": "If I am to be fallen into love, I will. And if as a result I will appear to be stupid, disillusioned, and of poor judgment, I will. And I would be damned if I cared what other people think. For I would rather be thought of as all of these things, than not love. If in loving, I become the naked woman on the horse, I will ride that horse with my head held high. This is my spirit. I am unbreakable."}
{"inputs": "Someday, we’ll run into each other again, I know it.Maybe I’ll be older and smarter and just plain better. If that happens, that’s when I’ll deserve you. But now, at this moment, you can’t hook your boat to mine, because I’m liable to sink us both."}
{"inputs": "A thousand half-loves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home."}
{"inputs": "Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead. --I shall feel it. She dropped her head again on Marius' knees, and her eyelids closed. He thought the poor soul had departed. Eponine remained motionless. All at once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death, and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world:-- And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in love with you."}
{"inputs": "I know you're tired but come, this is the way."}
{"inputs": "To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love. But then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love. To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy. Therefore, to be happy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness."}

{"inputs": "If I love you, what business is it of yours?"}
{"inputs": "You can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. People who refuse to stop believing. People who refuse to come to earth.

{"inputs": "Maybe the first time you saw her you were ten. She was standing in the sun scratching her legs. Or tracing letters in the dirt with a stick. Her hair was being pulled. Or she was pulling someone's hair. And a part of you was drawn to her, and a part of you resisted--wanting to ride off on your bicycle, kick a stone, remain uncomplicated. In the same breath you felt the strength of a man, and a self-pity that made you feel small and hurt. Part of you thought: Please don't look at me. If you don't, I can still turn away. And part of you thought: Look at me."}
{"inputs": "We kiss all the time. I clear my throat, then add, We just...do it in private. A smug expression crosses his face. I don't buy it for a second, 'cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin' in your house, I'd kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder. A reminder of w-w-what?

{"inputs": "Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agised as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love."}
{"inputs": "If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."}
{"inputs": "Love is a luxury. No. Love is an element. An element. Like air to breathe, earth to stand on."}
{"inputs": "Because I can't help doing it, he said with a shrug. And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me. I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic. Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will. I don't think you're evil. See? Things are already looking promising."}

{"inputs": "I have little left in myself -- I must have you. The world may laugh -- may call me absurd, selfish -- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame."}
{"inputs": "Let’s start with this statistic: You are delicious. Be brave, my sweet. I know you can get lonely. I know you can crave companionship and sex and love so badly that it physically hurts. But I truly believe that the only way you can find out that there’s something better out there is to first believe there’s something better out there. What other choice is there?"}

{"inputs": "I love you, he whispered, and that was the moment he knew what he was going to do. When you loved someone, you put their needs before your own. No matter how inconceivable those needs were; no matter how fucked up; no matter how much it made you feel like you were ripping yourself into pieces."}
{"inputs": "Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it's often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I've often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year. But most of all, I learned that it's possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there's been a lifetime of disappointment between them."}
{"inputs": "It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane? I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still. Because, he said, I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you - especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous channel, and two hundred miles or so of land some broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you'd forget me."}
{"inputs": "I mean, at the end of the day, what the hell does it matter who I end up with if it can't be you?"}
{"inputs": "She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was sad. No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary as her looks. She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful."}
{"inputs": "Kissing - and I mean like, yummy, smacking kissing - is the most delicious, most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do, bar none. Better than sex, hands down."}
{"inputs": "I want to try making things right because picking up the pieces is way better than leaving them the way they are."}
{"inputs": "Each relationship between two persons is absolutely unique. That is why you cannot love two people the same. It simply is not possible. You love each person differently because of who they are and the uniqueness that they draw out of you."}

{"inputs": "Yelena, you've driven me crazy. You've caused me considerable trouble and I've contemplated ending your life twice since I've known you. Valek's warm breath in my ear sent a shiver down my spine. But you’ve slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart.That sounds more like a poison than a person, was all I could say. His confession had both shocked and thrilled me.Exactly, Valek replied. You have poisoned me."}
{"inputs": "The power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely."}
{"inputs": "Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says, Love your enemies. It is this: that love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. Just keep being friendly to that person. Just keep loving them, and they can’t stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they’ll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And by the power of your love they will break down under the load. That’s love, you see. It is redemptive, and this is why Jesus says love. There’s something about love that builds up and is creative. There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive. So love your enemies. (from Loving Your Enemies )"}

That's what everyone wants. Not 24/7 hot wet sex. Not a marriage that lasts a hundred years. Not a Porsche...or a million-dollar crib. No. They wanna hold your hand. They have such a feeling that they can't hide. Every single successful song of the past fifty years can be traced back to 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.' And every single successful love story has those unbearable and unbearably exciting moments of hand-holding."}

{"inputs": "I've never forgotten him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once. The pain is like an axe that chops my heart."}

{"inputs": "I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve.

It’s the condition-less state of the heart. Not a feeling that comes and goes at the whim of the emotions. It is there in our heart, a part of our heart…eventually grafting itself into each limb and cell of our bodies. Love changes our brain, the way we move and talk. Love lives in our spirit and graces us with its presence each day, until death.To say I love you, but…. is to say, I did not love you at all.I say this to you now: I love you, with no beginning, no end. I love you as you have become an extra necessary organ in my body. I love you as only a girl could love a boy. Without fear. Without expectations.

The thoughts you loved to think about, the memories you wanted to hold up to the light and view from every angle--it suddenly seems a lot safer to lock them in a box, far from the light of day and throw away the key.

Tell love you want a momento of it and obtain a lock of its hair. Burn the hair in a dime-store incense burner with yin/yang symbols on three sides. Face southwest. Talk fast over the burning hair in a convincingly exotic language. Remove the ashes of the burnt hair and use them to paint a moustache on your face. Find love. Tell it you are someone new. It will stay.3. Wake love up in the middle of the night. Tell it the world is on fire. Dash to the bedroom window and pee out of it.

You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good.

They made up a thousand games. She was queen and he was king. In the autumn light her hair shone like a crown. They collected the world in small handfuls, and when the sky grew dark, and they parted with leaves in their hair.Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}

Vanity, fear, desire, competition-- all such distortions within our own egos-- condition our vision of those in relation to us. Add to those distortions to our own egos the corresponding distortions in the egos of others, and you see how cloudy the glass must become through which we look at each other.

{"inputs": "It’s important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences. You have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too. Nurture your mind with positive thoughts: kindness, empathy, compassion, peace, love, joy, humility, generosity, etc. The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life."}
{"inputs": "Last time I saw you, I said that it hurt too much to love you. But I was wrong about that. The truth is it hurts too much not to love you."}
{"inputs": "To love is to recognize yourself in another."}
{"inputs": "Yes... it wasn't over, it still isn't over."}
{"inputs": "I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he loves me."}
{"inputs": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sightFor the ends of being and ideal grace.I love thee to the level of every day'sMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.I love thee freely, as men strive for right.I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.I love thee with the passion put to useIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.I love thee with a love I seemed to loseWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."}
{"inputs": "You can live your whole life not realizing that what you're looking for is right in front of you."}
{"inputs": "It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,"}
{"inputs": "To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God."}
{"inputs": "When you love you wish to do things for. You wish to sacrifice for. You wish to serve."}
{"inputs": "That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough."}
{"inputs": "Oh, love isn't there to make us happy. I believe it exists to show us how much we can endure."}
{"inputs": "It starts so young, and I'm angry about that. The garbage we're taught. About love, about what's romantic. Look at so many of the so-called romantic figures in books and movies. Do we ever stop and think how many of them would cause serious and drastic unhappiness after The End? Why are sick and dangerous personality types so often shown a passionate and tragic and something to be longed for when those are the very ones you should run for your life from? Think about it. Heathcliff. Romeo. Don Juan. Jay Gatsby. Rochester. Mr. Darcy. From the rigid control freak in The Sound of Music to all the bad boys some woman goes running to the airport to catch in the last minute of every romantic comedy. She should let him leave. Your time is so valuable, and look at these guys--depressive and moody and violent and immature and self-centered. And what about the big daddy of them all, Prince Charming? What was his secret life? We dont know anything about him, other then he looks good and comes to the rescue."}
{"inputs": "You had to know a person well to make them laugh like that."}
{"inputs": "Desiring another person is perhaps the most risky endeavor of all. As soon as you want somebody—really want him—it is as though you have taken a surgical needle and sutured your happiness to the skin of that person, so that any separation will now cause a lacerating injury."}
{"inputs": "A busy, vibrant, goal-oriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence."}
{"inputs": "How do you know when it's over? Maybe when you feel more in love with your memories than with the person standing in front of you."}
{"inputs": "And you can't love, not fully, unless you are loved in return."}
{"inputs": "If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it."}
{"inputs": "Down on the lake rosy reflections of celestial vapor appeared, and I said, God, I love you and looked to the sky and really meant it. I have fallen in love with you, God. Take care of us all, one way or the other. To the children and the innocent it's all the same."}
{"inputs": "You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too."}
{"inputs": "And I can fight only for something that I love, love only what I respect, and respect only what I at least know."}
{"inputs": "The truest form of love is how you behave toward someone, not how you feel about them."}
{"inputs": "I go to sleep alone, and wake up alone. I take walks. I work until I'm tired. I watch the wind play with the trash that's been under the snow all winter. Everything seems simple until you think about it. Why is love intensified by abscence?"}
{"inputs": "The fact is…I’m in love with you, and I have been for some time."}
{"inputs": "He sighed and then focused his eyes right on me. It was like drowning, drowning in seas of green. There was nothing in the world except for those eyes. I want to kiss you, Rose, he said softly. And I want you to want me too."}
{"inputs": "Anne laughed. I don't want sunbursts or marble halls, I just want you."}
{"inputs": "There's always a moment when you start to fall out of love, whether it's with a person or an idea or a cause, even if it's one you only narrate to yourself years after the event: a tiny thing, a wrong word, a false note, which means that things can never be quite the same again."}
{"inputs": "If I love you, I will carry for you all your pain, I will assume for you all your debts (in every definition of the word), I will protect you from your own insecurity, I will protect upon you all sorts of good qualities that you have never actually cultivated in yourself and I will buy Christmas presents for your entire family. I will give you the sun and the rain, and if they are not available, I will give you a sun check and a rain check. I will give you all this and more, until I get so exhausted and depleted that the only way I can recover my energy is by becoming infatuated with someone else."}
{"inputs": "I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are there, in everything I am, in everything I've ever done, and looking back, I know that I should have told you know much you've always meant to me."}
{"inputs": "I'm the kind of boy that can fall in love with any girl because I love with the heart, not the eyes."}
{"inputs": "I want you any way I can get you. Not because you’re beautiful or clever or kind or adorable, although devil knows you’re all those things. I want you because there’s no one else like you, and I don’t ever want to start a day without seeing you."}
{"inputs": "I feel good with my husband: I like his warmth and his bigness and his being-there and his making and his jokes and stories and what he reads and how he likes fishing and walks and pigs and foxes and little animals and is honest and not vain or fame-crazy and how he shows his gladness for what I cook him and joy for when I make him something, a poem or a cake, and how he is troubled when I am unhappy and wants to do anything so I can fight out my soul-battles and grow up with courage and a philosophical ease. I love his good smell and his body that fits with mine as if they were made in the same body-shop to do just that. What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my husband. So I don't want to look around any more: I don't need to look around for anything."}
{"inputs": "No, it's not that. It's not what you're thinking. I was serious when I said 'all of it'. I can remember every moment we were together, and in eachof them there was something wonderful. I can't really pick any one time that meant more than any other. The entire summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone should have. How could I pick one moment over another? Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Any happiness, no matter how brief, seemed better than the long, simmering torture of waking up day after day, knowing I could never have him."}
{"inputs": "But maybe you never really had someone, she thought now. Maybe, no matter how much you loved them, they could slip through your fingers like water, and there was nothing you could do about it."}
{"inputs": "If having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude, then animals are better off than a lot of humans."}
{"inputs": "Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring."}
{"inputs": "So much of the language of love was like that: you devoured someone with your eyes, you drank in the sight of him, you swallowed him whole. Love was substance, broken down and beating through your bloodstream."}
{"inputs": "Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection."}
{"inputs": "Just because I'm not forever by your side doesn't mean that's not precisely where I want to be."}
{"inputs": "Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him."}
{"inputs": "If a man hasn't what's necessary to make a woman love him, it's his fault, not hers."}
{"inputs": "She's my kitten, and no one else's."}
{"inputs": "Work without love is slavery."}
{"inputs": "Love is where you find it. I think it is foolish to go around looking for it, and I think it can be poisonous. I wish that people who are conventionally supposed to love each other would say to each other, when they fight, 'Please — a little less love, and a little more common decency'."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than I hate everything else."}
{"inputs": "Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away, and he could not find it."}
{"inputs": "Love, like fire, goes out without fuel."}
{"inputs": "One thing: you have to walk, and create the way by your walking; you will not find a ready-made path. It is not so cheap, to reach to the ultimate realization of truth. You will have to create the path by walking yourself; the path is not ready-made, lying there and waiting for you. It is just like the sky: the birds fly, but they don't leave any footprints. You cannot follow them; there are no footprints left behind."}
{"inputs": "Love, when spelled backwards and read phonetically, reads evil"}
{"inputs": "I threw myself into that fire, threw myself into it, into him, and let myself burn."}
{"inputs": "Wait a second, Four says. I turn toward him, wondering which version of Four I'll see now-the one who scolds me, or the one who climbs Ferris wheels with me. He smiles a little, but the smile doesn't spread to his eyes, which look less tense and worried. You belong here, you know that? he says. You belong with us. It'll be over soon, so just hold on, okay? He scratches behind his ear and looks away, like he's embarrassed by what he said. I stare at him. I feel my heartbeat everywhere, even in my toes. I feel like doing something bold, but I could just as easily walk away. I am not sure which option is smarter, or better. I am not sure that I care.I reach out and take his hand. His fingers slide between mine. I can't breathe. I stare up at him, and he stares down at me. For a long moment, we stay that way. Then I pull my hand away and run after Uriah and Lynn and Marlene. Maybe now he thinks I'm stupid, or strange. Maybe it was worth it."}
{"inputs": "If somebody says 'I love you' to me, I feel as though I had a pistol pointed at my head. What can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol holder requires? 'I love you, too'."}
{"inputs": "He wasn't the type for displays of affection, either verbal or not. He was disgusted by couples that made out in the hallways between classes, and got annoyed at even the slightest sappy moments in movies. But I knew he cared about me: he just conveyed it more subtly, as concise with expressing this emotion as he was with everything else. It was in the way he'd put his hand on the small of my back, for instance, or how he'd smile at me when I said something that surprised him. Once I might have wanted more, but I'd come around to his way of thinking in the time we'd been together. And we were together, all the time. So he didn't have to prove how he felt about me. Like so much else, I should just know."}
{"inputs": "Marry me, Kiara, he blurts out in front of everyone.Why? she asks, challenging him.Because I love you, he says, walking up to her and bending down on one knee while he takes her hand in his, and I want to go to sleep with you every night and wake up seein’ your face every mornin’, I want you to be the mother of my children, I want to fix cars with you and eat your crappy tofu tacos that you think are Mexican. I want to climb mountains with you and be challenged by you, I want to argue with you just so we can have crazy hot makeup sex. Marry me, because without you I’d be six feet under … and because I love your family like they’re my own … and because you’re my best friend and I want to grow old with you. He starts tearing up, and it’s shocking because I’ve never seen him cry. Marry me, Kiara Westford, because when I got shot the only thing I was thinkin’ about was comin’ back here and makin’ you my wife. Say yes, chica."}
{"inputs": "But you're the only one, Scarlet. You'll always be the only one."}
{"inputs": "I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men. Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything."}
{"inputs": "The Simple PathSilence is PrayerPrayer is FaithFaith is LoveLove is ServiceThe Fruit of Service is Peace"}
{"inputs": "Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh.And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time.There is a good deal of comfort, now, in remembering this."}
{"inputs": "If you love deeply, you're going to get hurt badly. But it's still worth it."}
{"inputs": "Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious."}
{"inputs": "Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love."}
{"inputs": "…There is the heat of Love, the pulsing rush of Longing, the lover’s whisper, irresistible—magic to make the sanest man go mad."}
{"inputs": "There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love."}
{"inputs": "Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehendMore than cool reason ever comprehends.The lunatic, the lover and the poetAre of imagination all compact:One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;And as imagination bodies forthThe forms of things unknown, the poet's penTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothingA local habitation and a name."}
{"inputs": "Why is there ever this perverse cruelty in humankind, that makes us hurt most those we love best?"}
{"inputs": "There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it."}
{"inputs": "Transformation is my favorite game and in my experience, anger and frustration are the result of you not being authentic somewhere in your life or with someone in your life. Being fake about anything creates a block inside of you. Life can’t work for you if you don’t show up as you."}
{"inputs": "And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire."}
{"inputs": "The only obsession everyone wants: 'love.' People think that in falling in love they make themselves whole? The Platonic union of souls? I think otherwise. I think you're whole before you begin. And the love fractures you. You're whole, and then you're cracked open."}
{"inputs": "Often it is the most deserving people who cannot help loving those who destroy them."}
{"inputs": "Love like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive."}
{"inputs": "You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting."}
{"inputs": "Now I'd rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie."}
{"inputs": "After all, damn it, what does being in love mean if you can't trust a person."}
{"inputs": "If you’re smart, you care. And if you care, you love."}
{"inputs": "Love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable."}
{"inputs": "Love consists of not looking each other in the eye, but of looking outwardly in the same direction."}
{"inputs": "If you send out goodness from yourself, or if you share that which is happy or good within you, it will all come back to you multiplied ten thousand times. In the kingdom of love there is no competition; there is no possessiveness or control. The more love you give away, the more love you will have."}
{"inputs": "And in the end, we were all just humans.. drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness."}
{"inputs": "Never give all the heart, for loveWill hardly seem worth thinking ofTo passionate women if it seemCertain, and they never dreamThat it fades out from kiss to kiss;For everything that's lovely isBut a brief, dreamy, kind delight.O Never give the heart outright, For they, for all smooth lips can say, Have given their hearts up to the play.And who could play it well enoughIf deaf and dumb and blind with love? He that made this knows all the cost, For he gave all his heart and lost."}
{"inputs": "You can obsess and obsess over how things ended—what you did wrong or could have done differently—but there's not much of a point. It's not like it'll change anything. So really, why worry?"}
{"inputs": "You asked why I couldn't forgive you, Nick said, very quietly, and I jumped a little. It was because you were the love of my life, Harper. And you didn't want to be. That's hard to let go."}
{"inputs": "The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."}
{"inputs": "Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."}
{"inputs": "Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing on earth more beautiful to me than your smile...no sound sweeter than your laughter...no pleasure greater than holding you in my arms. I realized today that I could never live without you, stubborn little hellion that you are. In this life and the next, you’re my only hope of happiness. Tell me, Lillian, dearest love...how can you have reached so far inside my heart?"}
{"inputs": "i carry your heart with me(i carry it in my heart)"}
{"inputs": "His breath hitched, and he regarded me hungrily. You’re playing with fire, you know that? That’s weird, considering you’re an ice prin— I didn’t get any further, as Ash leaned in and kissed me."}
{"inputs": "Blood of my Blood, he whispered, and bone of my bone. You carry me within ye, Claire, and ye canna leave me now, no matter what happens, You are mine, always, if ye will it or no, if ye want me or nay. Mine, and I wilna let ye go."}
{"inputs": "Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself."}
{"inputs": "She hardly ever thought of him. He had worn a place for himself in some corner of her heart, as a sea shell, always boring against the rock, might do. The making of the place had been her pain. But now the shell was safely in the rock. It was lodged, and ground no longer."}
{"inputs": "Being with her I feel a pain, like a frozen knife stuck in my chest. An awful pain, but the funny thing is I'm thankful for it. It's like that frozen pain and my very existence are one."}
{"inputs": "Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear."}
{"inputs": "I don't care if you say we can't be together. I don't care if you think I'm the most evil, unnatural creature walking on earth. You can think whatever you want, go whatever you want. I'm going to just go on loving you, even if it's hopeless."}
{"inputs": "You're a hero and a gentleman, you're kind and honest, but more than that, you're the first man I ever truly loved. And no matter what the future brings, you always will be, and I know that my life is better for it."}
{"inputs": "You made me feel alive again."}
{"inputs": "I have learned that you can go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do and buy all the things that you want to buy and meet all the people that you want to meet and learn all the things that you desire to learn and if you do all these things but are not madly in love: you have still not begun to live."}
{"inputs": "And now, Eric yelled into his mircophone, we're going to sing a new song-one we just wrote. This one's for my girlfriend. We've been going out for three weeks, and, damn, our love is true. We're gonna be together forever, baby. This one's called 'Bang You Like a Drum.'"}
{"inputs": "It is a defect of God's humor that he directs our hearts everywhere but to those who have a right to them."}
{"inputs": "That's why I loved being with you. We could do the simplest things, like toss starfish into the ocean and share a burger and talk and even then I knew that I was fortunate. Because you were the first guy who wasn't constantly trying to impress me. You accepted who you were, but more than that, you accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered-- not my family or your family or anyone else in the world. It was just us."}
{"inputs": "The minute I stopped trying to find the right girl, and started trying to become the right guy...the girl came."}
{"inputs": "Don't go looking for boys in the darkThey will say pretty things thenleave you with scars.Do go looking for boys in the parkFor that is where the true gentlemen are."}
{"inputs": "Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats."}
{"inputs": "Don't worry about hurting me, if that's what you're afraid of. I want to get hurt. At least I´ll feel something for a change."}
{"inputs": "When you drop a glass or a plate to the ground it makes a loud crashing sound. When a window shatters a table leg breaks or when a picture falls off the wall it makes a noise. But as for your heart when that breaks it s completely silent. You would think as it s so important it would make the loudest noise in the whole world or even have some ... Read Moresort of ceremonious sound like the gong of a cymbal or the ringing of a bell. But it s silent and you almost wish there was a noise to distract you from the pain. If there is a noise it s internal. It screams and no one can hear it but you. It screams so loud your ears ring and your head aches. It trashes around in your chest like a great white shark caught in the sea it roars like a mother bear whose cub has been taken. That s what it looks like and that s what it sounds like a trashing panicking trapped great big beast roaring like a prisoner to its own emotions. But that s the thing about love no one is untouchable."}
{"inputs": "To love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise."}
{"inputs": "Everybody is a main character to someone..."}
{"inputs": "He was not my boyfriend. On the other hand, he wasn't just a friend either. Instead, our relationship was elastic, stretching between those two extremes depending on who else was around, how much either of us had to drink, and other varying factors. This was exactly what I wanted, as commitments had never really been my thing. And it wasn't like it was hard, either. The only trick was never giving more than you were willing to lose."}
{"inputs": "A true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways, even though he has not offended a lady intentionally. He is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a woman's heart."}
{"inputs": "They send a person who can never stay, she whispered. Who can never accept my offer of companionship for more than a little while. They send me a hero I can't help ... just the sort of person I can't help falling in love with. ...As I sailed into the lake I realized the Fates really were cruel. They sent Calypso someone she couldn't help but love. But it worked both ways. For the rest of my life I would be thinking about her. She would always be my biggest what if."}
{"inputs": "You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say."}
{"inputs": "I think in the end, you would have stayed with me, out of obligation...or maybe comfort. Maybe I was safe to you, and you needed to feel that. I know how scared you get of the unknown. To you...I must be kind of a security blanket. Do you see now, how that doesn't work for me? I don't want to be there, simply because the idea of me being gone is too...scary. I want to be someone's everything. I want fire and passion, and love that's returned, equally. I want to be someone's heart... Even if it means breaking my own."}
{"inputs": "Love one another, but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn't mean anything if you're not willing to make a commitment, and you have to think not only about what you want, but about what he wants. Not just now, but in the future."}
