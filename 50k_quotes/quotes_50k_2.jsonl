{"inputs": "I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."}
{"inputs": "You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth."}
{"inputs": "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."}
{"inputs": "A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you."}
{"inputs": "Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."}
{"inputs": "We accept the love we think we deserve."}
{"inputs": "It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."}
{"inputs": "As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."}
{"inputs": "The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."}
{"inputs": "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."}
{"inputs": "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."}
{"inputs": "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up."}
{"inputs": "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."}
{"inputs": "There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."}
{"inputs": "Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."}
{"inputs": "You love me. Real or not real? I tell him, Real."}
{"inputs": "You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there."}
{"inputs": "I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.."}
{"inputs": "I'm in love with you, he said quietly. Augustus, I said. I am, he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."}
{"inputs": "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."}
{"inputs": "Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."}
{"inputs": "People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."}
{"inputs": "If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."}
{"inputs": "You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}
{"inputs": "We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."}
{"inputs": "Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."}
{"inputs": "The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space."}
{"inputs": "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever."}
{"inputs": "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."}
{"inputs": "When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."}
{"inputs": "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. After all this time? Always, said Snape."}
{"inputs": "I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing."}
{"inputs": "To die will be an awfully big adventure."}
{"inputs": "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."}
{"inputs": "So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."}
{"inputs": "Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can."}
{"inputs": "Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you."}
{"inputs": "The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."}
{"inputs": "Some people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them, I said. Right, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That's what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway."}
{"inputs": "I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."}
{"inputs": "Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you."}
{"inputs": "When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always."}
{"inputs": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."}
{"inputs": "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving."}
{"inputs": "When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."}
{"inputs": "We love the things we love for what they are."}
{"inputs": "I would die for you. But I won't live for you."}
{"inputs": "In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."}
{"inputs": "You are, and always have been, my dream."}
{"inputs": "You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together."}
{"inputs": "I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is youhere is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)"}
{"inputs": "The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."}
{"inputs": "So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."}
{"inputs": "And now I’m looking at you, he said, and you’re asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before – bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it – but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me."}
{"inputs": "Where there is love there is life."}
{"inputs": "Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary."}
{"inputs": "I would always rather be happy than dignified."}
{"inputs": "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."}
{"inputs": "Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}
{"inputs": "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."}
{"inputs": "The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever"}
{"inputs": "There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."}
{"inputs": "We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."}
{"inputs": "I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."}
{"inputs": "We loved with a love that was more than love."}
{"inputs": "And so the lion fell in love with the lamb… he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. What a stupid lamb, I sighed. What a sick, masochistic lion."}
{"inputs": "This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something."}
{"inputs": "Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet."}
{"inputs": "I heard what you said. I’m not the silly romantic you think. I don’t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don’t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."}
{"inputs": "A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"}
{"inputs": "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! "}
{"inputs": "Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something."}
{"inputs": "He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."}
{"inputs": "I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear."}
{"inputs": "What's meant to be will always find a way"}
{"inputs": "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love."}
{"inputs": "Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing there is a field.I'll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about."}
{"inputs": "Everyone, at some point in their lives, wakes up in the middle of the night with the feeling that they are all alone in the world, and that nobody loves them now and that nobody will ever love them, and that they will never have a decent night's sleep again and will spend their lives wandering blearily around a loveless landscape, hoping desperately that their circumstances will improve, but suspecting, in their heart of hearts, that they will remain unloved forever. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to wake somebody else up, so that they can feel this way, too."}
{"inputs": "They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."}
{"inputs": "Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that's beautiful."}
{"inputs": "No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that's the key. It's like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot."}
{"inputs": "The heart was made to be broken."}
{"inputs": "Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."}
{"inputs": "I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."}
{"inputs": "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."}
{"inputs": "For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."}
{"inputs": "They didn’t agree on much. In fact, they didn’t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."}
{"inputs": "You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me. She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. But I don't want anything else in the world."}
{"inputs": "I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."}
{"inputs": "Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."}
{"inputs": "Love is so short, forgetting is so long."}
{"inputs": "To douchebags! he said, gesturing to Brad. And to girls that break your heart, he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."}
{"inputs": "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."}
{"inputs": "The very essence of romance is uncertainty."}
{"inputs": "What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction."}
{"inputs": "There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."}
{"inputs": "My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away."}
{"inputs": "If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger."}
{"inputs": "Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it."}
{"inputs": "And, in the endThe love you take is equal to the love you make."}
{"inputs": "What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again."}
{"inputs": "It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head."}
{"inputs": "Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction."}
{"inputs": "I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life? ' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did? "}
{"inputs": "If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. Busy is another word for asshole. Asshole is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call."}
{"inputs": "Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell."}
{"inputs": "I have something I need to tell you, he says. I run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him. I might be in love with you. He smiles a little. I'm waiting until I'm sure to tell you, though. That's sensible of you, I say, smiling too. We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something. I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear. Maybe I'm already sure, he says, and I just don't want to frighten you. I laugh a little. Then you should know better. Fine, he says. Then I love you."}
{"inputs": "You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have."}
{"inputs": "I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, 'So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me? ' I turn into him. 'Put you somewhere you can't get hurt."}
{"inputs": "If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets."}
{"inputs": "I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."}
{"inputs": "We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, This is the problem I want to have.I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way."}
{"inputs": "It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new."}
{"inputs": "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."}
{"inputs": "My dear, Find what you love and let it kill you.Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it’s much better to be killed by a lover.~ Falsely yours"}
{"inputs": "If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don't let her go."}
{"inputs": "How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em."}
{"inputs": "If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him."}
{"inputs": "Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong."}
{"inputs": "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."}
{"inputs": "I love you. Remember. They cannot take it"}
{"inputs": "Do you think I'm pretty? I think you're beautifulBeautiful? You are so beautiful, it hurts sometimes."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea."}
{"inputs": "When love is not madness it is not love."}
{"inputs": "Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."}
{"inputs": "A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her."}
{"inputs": "Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited."}
{"inputs": "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."}
{"inputs": "True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning."}
{"inputs": "What's this? he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there. It's a girl, Jace said, recovering his composure. Surely you've seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one."}
{"inputs": "Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."}
{"inputs": "Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired."}
{"inputs": "I was smiling yesterday, I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything."}
{"inputs": "Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."}
{"inputs": "It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done."}
{"inputs": "I love you also means I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else."}
{"inputs": "There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. Is this the moment? Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. OI! There's a war going on here! Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. I know, mate, said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, so it's now or never, isn't it? Never mind that, what about the Horcrux? Harry shouted. D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem? Yeah --- right --- sorry --- said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."}
{"inputs": "If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain."}
{"inputs": "When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace."}
{"inputs": "I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts."}
{"inputs": "It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them. "}
{"inputs": "The greater the love, the greater the tragedy when it's over."}
{"inputs": "Hate the sin, love the sinner."}
{"inputs": "Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness."}
{"inputs": "One love, one heart, one destiny."}
{"inputs": "I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be."}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it's these things I'd believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn't all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."}
{"inputs": "If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn't be filled? "}
{"inputs": "It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful."}
{"inputs": "Well, nowIf little by little you stop loving meI shall stop loving youLittle by littleIf suddenly you forget meDo not look for meFor I shall already have forgotten youIf you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my lifeAnd you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have rootsRememberThat on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my armsAnd my roots will set off to seek another land"}
{"inputs": "You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It's not overrated. There's a reason for all those songs."}
{"inputs": "What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul"}
{"inputs": "All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart."}
{"inputs": "To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death."}
{"inputs": "I love you like a fat kid loves cake! "}
{"inputs": "If she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for."}
{"inputs": "It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal."}
{"inputs": "We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved."}
{"inputs": "Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love."}
{"inputs": "We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."}
{"inputs": "They say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same, but I don't think it's possible for you to miss me as much as I'm missing you right now"}
{"inputs": "And when her lips met mine, I knew that I could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world, but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when I first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever."}
{"inputs": "Any fool can be happy. It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep."}
{"inputs": "Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee."}
{"inputs": "You couldn't relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. You had to accept it as a whole--like the world, or the person you loved."}
{"inputs": "What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love."}
{"inputs": "Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart."}
{"inputs": "Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person's ultimate good as far as it can be obtained."}
{"inputs": "The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."}
{"inputs": "Life, he realize, was much like a song. In the beginning there is mystery, in the end there is confirmation, but it's in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile."}
{"inputs": "Find what you love and let it kill you."}
{"inputs": "It’s probably not just by chance that I’m alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he’s terribly strong. And if he’s stronger than I, I’m the one who can’t live with him. … I’m neither smart nor stupid, but I don’t think I’m a run-of-the-mill person. I’ve been in business without being a businesswoman, I’ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men I’ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I’ve done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice."}
{"inputs": "Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being in love , which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident."}
{"inputs": "Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."}
{"inputs": "The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends."}
{"inputs": "Look after my heart - I've left it with you."}
{"inputs": "Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect."}
{"inputs": "One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well."}
{"inputs": "I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary."}
{"inputs": "And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me."}
{"inputs": "He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry."}
{"inputs": "I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."}
{"inputs": "Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time."}
{"inputs": "You can't measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange."}
{"inputs": "Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn’t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes it's a form of love just to talk to somebody that you have nothing in common with and still be fascinated by their presence."}
{"inputs": "How do you spell 'love'? - Piglet You don't spell it...you feel it. - Pooh"}
{"inputs": "Tonight I can write the saddest linesI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too."}
{"inputs": "I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a savage harvest, hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart, Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue."}
{"inputs": "Happiness is only real when shared"}
{"inputs": "A DEFINITION NOT FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY Not leaving: an act of trust and love, often deciphered by children"}
{"inputs": "One day you will kiss a man you can't breathe without, and find that breath is of little consequence."}
{"inputs": "Maybe...you'll fall in love with me all over again. Hell, I said, I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me? Yes. I want to ruin you. Good, I said. That's what I want too."}
{"inputs": "Was it hard? I ask.Letting go? Not as hard as holding on to something that wasn't real."}
{"inputs": "I'm saying that I'm a moody, insecure, narrow-minded, jealous, borderline homicidal bitch, and I want you to promise me that you're okay with that, because it's who I am, and you're what I need."}
{"inputs": "Then I realize what it is. It's him. Something about him makes me feel like I am about to fall. Or turn to liquid. Or burst into flames."}
{"inputs": "Art and love are the same thing: It’s the process of seeing yourself in things that are not you."}
{"inputs": "Letting go doesn't mean that you don't care about someone anymore. It's just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself."}
{"inputs": "As if you were on fire from within.The moon lives in the lining of your skin."}
{"inputs": "The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them"}
{"inputs": "Promise me you'll never forget me because if I thought you would, I'd never leave."}
{"inputs": "Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who's in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It's like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven't seen in a long time."}
{"inputs": "I could not tell you if I loved you the first moment I saw you, or if it was the second or third or fourth. But I remember the first moment I looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you."}
{"inputs": "I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity."}
{"inputs": "When I am with you, we stay up all night.When you're not here, I can't go to sleep.Praise God for those two insomnias! And the difference between them."}
{"inputs": "I loved you like a man loves a woman he never touches, only writes to, keeps little photographs of."}
{"inputs": "You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection"}
{"inputs": "Tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness. They are a sign of a pure heart."}
{"inputs": "The saddest people I've ever met in life are the ones who don't care deeply about anything at all. Passion and satisfaction go hand in hand, and without them, any happiness is only temporary, because there's nothing to make it last."}
{"inputs": "She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers...She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on..."}
{"inputs": "If conversation was the lyrics, laughter was the music, making time spent together a melody that could be replayed over and over without getting stale."}
{"inputs": "You could have fooled me. Everytime I called you, Luke said you were sick. I figured you were avoiding me. Again. I wasn't. I did want to talk to you. I've been thinking about you all the time. I've been thinking about you, too. I really was sick. I swear. I almost died back there on the ship, you know. I know. Everytime you almost die, I almost die myself."}
{"inputs": "We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and—in spite of True Romance magazines—we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely—at least, not all the time—but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."}
{"inputs": "It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me."}
{"inputs": "In time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go. At least I thought it was. But in every boy I met in the next few years, I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong, I'd write you another letter. But I never sent them for fear of what I might find. By then, you'd gone on with your life and I didn't want to think about you loving someone else. I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. I didn't ever want to lose that."}
{"inputs": "There is only one page left to write on. I will fill it with words of only one syllable. I love. I have loved. I will love."}
{"inputs": "Happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago.Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything."}
{"inputs": "A half-read book is a half-finished love affair."}
{"inputs": "To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."}
{"inputs": "I like flaws. I think they make things interesting."}
{"inputs": "Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."}
{"inputs": "I'm oxygen and he's dying to breathe."}
{"inputs": "Who, being loved, is poor? "}
{"inputs": "Lost love is still love. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it."}
{"inputs": "I read once that the ancient Egyptians had fifty words for sand & the Eskimos had a hundred words for snow. I wish I had a thousand words for love, but all that comes to mind is the way you move against me while you sleep & there are no words for that."}
{"inputs": "Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another."}
{"inputs": "I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won't."}
{"inputs": "I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia."}
{"inputs": "Peeta, how come I never know when you're having a nightmare? I say.I don't know. I don't think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just come to, paralyzed with terror, he says.You should wake me, I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.It's not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you, he says. I'm okay once I realize you're here."}
{"inputs": "A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."}
{"inputs": "It is easy to love people in memory the hard thing is to love them when they are there in front of you. "}
{"inputs": "The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come."}
{"inputs": "Love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby- awkwardly, and often with a great deal of mess."}
{"inputs": "When I saw you I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew."}
{"inputs": "You know how they say you only hurt the ones you love? Well, it works both ways."}
{"inputs": "Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I can not live without my life! I can not live without my soul! "}
{"inputs": "I fell in love with her when we were together, then fell deeper in love with her in the years we were apart."}
{"inputs": "What she had realized was that love was that moment when your heart was about to burst."}
{"inputs": "I know we're fucked up, alright? I'm impulsive, and hot tempered, and you get under my skin like no one else. You act like you hate me one minute, and then need me the next. I never get anything right, and I don't deserve you...but I fucking love you, Abby. I love you more than I loved anyone or anything ever. When you're around, I don't need booze, or money, or the fighting, or the one-night stands..."}
{"inputs": "Sorrow is how we learn to love. Your heart isn't breaking. It hurts because it's getting larger. The larger it gets, the more love it holds."}
{"inputs": "Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing."}
{"inputs": "One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life:That word is love."}
{"inputs": "Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those."}
{"inputs": "Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be."}
{"inputs": "It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know. We all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and, giving out nothing, receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death."}
{"inputs": "I guess that’s just part of loving people: You have to give things up. Sometimes you even have to give them up."}
{"inputs": "I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face, I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine."}
{"inputs": "The more one judges, the less one loves."}
{"inputs": "The heart has its reasons which reason knows not."}
{"inputs": "The emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it..."}
{"inputs": "Time was passing like a hand waving from a train I wanted to be on. I hope you never have to think about anything as much as I think about you."}
{"inputs": "Do not fall in love with people like me. I will take you to museums, and parks, and monuments, and kiss you in every beautiful place, so that you can never go back to them without tasting me like blood in your mouth.I will destroy you in the most beautiful way possible. And when I leave you will finally understand, why storms are named after people."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes love means letting go when you want to hold on tighter."}
{"inputs": "Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive."}
{"inputs": "Trust your heart if the seas catch fire, live by love though the stars walk backward."}
{"inputs": "The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books"}
{"inputs": "If someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody I love, I would eat them. I might end up in jail for 500 years, but I would eat them."}
{"inputs": "From childhood's hour I have not been. As others were, I have not seen. As others saw, I could not awaken. My heart to joy at the same tone. And all I loved, I loved alone."}
{"inputs": "Come sleep with me: We won't make Love, Love will make us."}
{"inputs": "People have forgotten this truth, the fox said. But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose."}
{"inputs": "If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that, too. I was talking to Liz and she said maybe coming back to your old life would be too painful, that maybe it'd be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I'd do it. I can lose you like that if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay."}
{"inputs": "Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love."}
{"inputs": "When someone is in your heart, they're never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times."}
{"inputs": "Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation."}
{"inputs": "Don't cry over someone who wouldn't cry over you."}
{"inputs": "Absence diminishes small loves and increases great ones, as the wind blows out the candle and fans the bonfire."}
{"inputs": "Being with you never felt wrong. It's the one thing I did right. You're the one thing I did right."}
{"inputs": "I wonder how many people don't get the one they want, but end up with the one they're supposed to be with."}
{"inputs": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach"}
{"inputs": "When you trip over love, it is easy to get up. But when you fall in love, it is impossible to stand again."}
{"inputs": "This is where it all begins. Everything starts here, today."}
{"inputs": "to love life, to love it even when you have no stomach for it and everything you've held dear crumbles like burnt paper in your hands, your throat filled with the silt of it.When grief sits with you, its tropical heatthickening the air, heavy as watermore fit for gills than lungs;when grief weights you like your own fleshonly more of it, an obesity of grief, you think, How can a body withstand this? Then you hold life like a facebetween your palms, a plain face, no charming smile, no violet eyes, and you say, yes, I will take youI will love you, again."}
{"inputs": "Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face - I know it's an impossibility, but I cannot help myself."}
{"inputs": "To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous."}
{"inputs": "I’ve been fighting to be who I am all my life. What’s the point of being who I am, if I can’t have the person who was worth all the fighting for? "}
{"inputs": "I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me."}
{"inputs": "In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art."}
{"inputs": "The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only."}
{"inputs": "True love is usually the most inconvenient kind."}
{"inputs": "You’ll get over it… It’s the clichés that cause the trouble. To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever. You don’t get over it because ‘it is the person you loved. The pain stops, there are new people, but the gap never closes. How could it? The particularness of someone who mattered enough to grieve over is not made anodyne by death. This hole in my heart is in the shape of you and no-one else can fit it. Why would I want them to? "}
{"inputs": "Watch out for intellect, because it knows so much it knows nothing and leaves you hanging upside down, mouthing knowledge as your heart falls out of your mouth."}
{"inputs": "We're staying together, he promised. You're not getting away from me. Never again."}
{"inputs": "The sunlight claps the earth, and the moonbeams kiss the sea: what are all these kissings worth, if thou kiss not me? "}
{"inputs": "Even After All this timeThe Sun never says to the Earth, You owe me. LookWhat happensWith a love like that, It lights the whole sky."}
{"inputs": "When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed."}
{"inputs": "To lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a balanced life."}
{"inputs": "You know it's never fifty-fifty in a marriage. It's always seventy-thirty, or sixty-forty. Someone falls in love first. Someone puts someone else up on a pedestal. Someone works very hard to keep things rolling smoothly; someone else sails along for the ride."}
{"inputs": "If you love something set it free, but don't be surprised if it comes back with herpes."}
{"inputs": "My wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness."}
{"inputs": "The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember that."}
{"inputs": "Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country."}
{"inputs": "I sought to hear the voice of God and climbed the topmost steeple, but God declared: Go down again - I dwell among the people."}
{"inputs": "The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine."}
{"inputs": "If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."}
{"inputs": "sometimes you don't need a goal in life, you don't need to know the big picture. you just need to know what you're going to do next! "}
{"inputs": "We are who we are, be­cause of those we choose to love and be­cause of those who love us."}
{"inputs": "I won't ever leave you, even though you're always leaving me."}
{"inputs": "This is what we call love. When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you."}
{"inputs": "I love you as certain dark things are loved, secretly, between the shadow and the soul."}
{"inputs": "The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the only thing people regret is that they didn't live boldly enough, that they didn't invest enough heart, didn't love enough. Nothing else really counts at all."}
{"inputs": "We are not trapped or locked up in these bones. No, no. We are free to change. And love changes us. And if we can love one another, we can break open the sky."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena."}
{"inputs": "Ok. You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole. Is this a pretty accurate description of our relationship."}
{"inputs": "You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince"}
{"inputs": "I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word busy is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want."}
{"inputs": "About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all."}

{"inputs": "The world was collapsing, and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive."}
{"inputs": "When I look in the mirror, I know I’m looking at someone who isn’t sure she deserves to be loved at all."}

{"inputs": "The course of true love never did run smooth."}
{"inputs": "Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze. "}
{"inputs": "If there is no love in the world, we will make a new world, and we will give it walls, and we will furnish it with soft, red interiors, from the inside out, and give it a knocker that resonates like a diamond falling to a jeweller's felt so that we should never hear it. Love me, because love doesn't exist, and I have tried everything that does."}
{"inputs": "In a perfect world, you could fuck people without giving them a piece of your heart. And every glittering kiss and every touch of flesh is another shard of heart you’ll never see again."}
{"inputs": "The human heart is a strange vessel. Love and hatred can exist side by side."}
{"inputs": "For where all love is, the speaking is unnecessary"}
{"inputs": "Someday you're gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving. You'll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken, but your life was changing..."}
{"inputs": "When we meet someone and fall in love, we have a sense that the whole universe is on our side. And yet if something goes wrong, there is nothing left! How is it possible for the beauty that was there only minutes before to vanish so quickly? Life moves very fast. It rushes from heaven to hell in a matter of seconds."}
{"inputs": "Spending time with you showed me what I’ve been missing in my life."}
{"inputs": "In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them."}

Deny thy father refuse thy name, thou art thyself thou not a montegue, what is montegue? tis nor hand nor foot nor any other part belonging to a man What is in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, So Romeo would were he not Romeo called retain such dear perfection to which he owes without that title, Romeo, Doth thy name! And for that name which is no part of thee, take all thyself."}
{"inputs": "Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew - knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest - was how love gave someone the power to break you"}

{"inputs": "I know that's what people say-- you'll get over it. I'd say it, too. But I know it's not true. Oh, you'll be happy again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him."}
{"inputs": "Love is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. If love were only a feeling, there would be no basis for the promise to love each other forever. A feeling comes and it may go. How can I judge that it will stay forever, when my act does not involve judgment and decision."}
{"inputs": "But love is always new. Regardless of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always face a brand-new situation. Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere. We simply have to accept it, because it is what nourishes our existence. If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. We have to take love where we find it, even if that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness.The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us. And to save us."}

{"inputs": "I'd learned that some things are best kept secret."}
{"inputs": "You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won’t tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you’ve done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you’re tired. You’re in a car with a beautiful boy, and you’re trying not to tell him that you love him, and you’re trying to choke down the feeling, and you’re trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you’ve discovered something you didn’t even have a name for."}
{"inputs": "Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it."}
{"inputs": "And next time you're planning to injure yourself to get me attention, just remember that a little sweet talk works wonders."}
{"inputs": "I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend. The one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them. I want to know every curve, every freckle, every shiver of your body. I want to know where to touch you, I want to know how to touch you. I want to know convince you to design a smile just for me. Yes, I do want to be your friend. I want to be your best friend in the entire world."}

{"inputs": "The highest function of love is that it makes the loved one a unique and irreplaceable being."}
{"inputs": "I know enough to know that no woman should ever marry a man who hated his mother."}
{"inputs": "We are told that people stay in love because of chemistry, or because they remain intrigued with each other, because of many kindnesses, because of luck. But part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness. "}
{"inputs": "NO. No no no. I don't want to screw you. I just love you. When did who you want to screw become the whole game? Since when is the person you want to screw the only person you get to love? It's so stupid, Tiny! I mean, Jesus, who even gives a fuck about sex? ! People act like it's the most important thing humans do, but come on. How can our sentient fucking lives revolve around something slugs can do. I mean, who you want to screw and whether you screw them? Those are important questions, I guess. But they're not that important. You know what's important? Who would you die for? Who do you wake up at five forty-five in the morning for even though you don't even know why he needs you? Whose drunken nose would you pick? ! "}
{"inputs": "And what would humans be without love? RARE, said Death."}
{"inputs": "Of course you can have a true Shadowhunter name, Will said. You can have mine. Tessa stared at him, all black and white against the black-and-white snow and stone. Your name? Will took a step toward her, till they stood face-to-face. Then he reached to take her hand and slid off her glove, which he put into his pocket. He held her bare hand in his, his fingers curved around hers. His hand was warm and callused, and his touch made her shiver. His eyes were steady and blue; they were everything that Will was: true and tender, sharp and witty, loving and kind. Marry me, he said. Marry me, Tess. Marry me and be called Tessa Herondale. Or be Tessa Gray, or be whatever you wish to call yourself, but marry me and stay with me and never leave me, for I cannot bear another day of my life to go by that does not have you in it."}
{"inputs": "I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent. "}
{"inputs": "Afterward, I had the last laugh. I made an air bubble at the bottom of the lake. Our friends kept waiting for us to come up, but hey-when you are the son of Poseidon, you don't have to hurry. And it was pretty much the best underwater kiss of all time."}
{"inputs": "Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart"}
{"inputs": "True love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the well-being of one's companion."}
{"inputs": "Hearts are breakable, Isabelle said. And I think even when you heal, you're never what you were before ."}
{"inputs": "Just because you're beautiful and perfect, it's made you conceited."}

{"inputs": "By the time you swear you're his, Shivering and sighing.And he vows his passion is, Infinite, undying.Lady make note of this --One of you is lying."}
{"inputs": "Anxiety is love's greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic."}
{"inputs": "I'll fight it. I'll fight it for you. Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'm okay. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time."}

{"inputs": "Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love."}
{"inputs": "The heart is the toughest part of the body. Tenderness is in the hands."}
{"inputs": "Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow."}
{"inputs": "She was my dream. She made me who I am, and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat. I think about her all the time. Even now, when I'm sitting here, I think about her. There could never have been another."}
{"inputs": "The soul is healed by being with children."}
{"inputs": "People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility."}
{"inputs": "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get - only with what you are expecting to give - which is everything"}
{"inputs": "I wondered what happened when you offered yourself to someone, and they opened you, only to discover you were not the gift they expected and they had to smile and nod and say thank you all the same."}
{"inputs": "When it's gone, you'll know what a gift love was. You'll suffer like this. So go back and fight to keep it."}
{"inputs": "Romance is thinking about your significant other, when you are supposed to be thinking about something else."}
{"inputs": "If you're a bird... I'm a bird..."}
{"inputs": "I told you. You don't love someone because of their looks or their clothes or their car. You love them because they sing a song only your heart can understand."}
{"inputs": "True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."}
{"inputs": "The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day."}
{"inputs": "Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. You said I killed you--haunt me then. The murdered do haunt their murderers. I believe--I know that ghosts have wandered the earth. Be with me always--take any form--drive me mad. Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! It is unutterable!

{"inputs": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! - I have as much soul as you, - and full as much heart!

"}
{"inputs": "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring barque, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved."}
{"inputs": "You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."}

{"inputs": "Well? Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. How was it? Harry considered it for a moment. Wet, he said truthfully.Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell. Because she was crying, Harry continued heavily. Oh, said Ron, his smile faded slightly. Are you that bad at kissing? Dunno, said Harry, who hadn't considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. Maybe I am."}
{"inputs": "Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another? We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close can we come to that person's essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone? "}

{"inputs": "Yours is the light by which my spirit's born: - you are my sun, my moon, and all my stars."}
{"inputs": "It's bullshit to think of friendship and romance as being different. They're not. They're just variations of the same love. Variations of the same desire to be close."}
{"inputs": "If my love were an ocean, there would be no more land.If my love were a desert, you would see only sand.If my love were a star-late at night, only light.And if my love could grow wings, I'd be soaring in flight."}
{"inputs": "Love, it never dies. It never goes away, it never fades, so long as you hang on to it. Love can make you immortal"}
{"inputs": "I've been in love before, it's like a narcotic. At first it brings the euphoria of complete surrender. The next day you want more. You're not addicted yet, but you like the sensation, and you think you can still control things.You think about the person you love for two minutes then forget them for three hours. But then you get used to that person, and you begin to be completely dependent on them. Now you think about him for three hours and forget him for two minutes. If he's not there, you feel like an addict who can't get a fix. And just as addicts steal and humiliate themselves to get what they need, you're willing to do anything for love. - By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept"}
{"inputs": "It's hard being left behind. (...) It's hard to be the one who stays."}
{"inputs": "Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman)."}
{"inputs": "Why are old lovers able to become friends? Two reasons. They never truly loved each other, or they love each other still."}
{"inputs": "and he suddenly knew that if she killed herself, he would die. Maybe not immediately, maybe not with the same blinding rush of pain, but it would happen. You couldn't live for very long without a heart."}
{"inputs": "She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second."}
{"inputs": "I think I fell in love with her, a little bit. Isn't that dumb? But it was like I knew her. Like she was my oldest, dearest friend. The kind of person you can tell anything to, no matter how bad, and they'll still love you, because they know you. I wanted to go with her. I wanted her to notice me. And then she stopped walking. Under the moon, she stopped. And looked at us. She looked at me. Maybe she was trying to tell me something; I don't know. She probably didn't even know I was there. But I'll always love her. All my life."}
{"inputs": "Moments, when lost, can't be found again. They're just gone."}
{"inputs": "here she is, all mine, trying her best to give me all she can. How could I ever hurt her? But I didn’t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair."}
{"inputs": "I like not only to be loved, but also to be told that I am loved. I am not sure that you are of the same mind. But the realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave. This is the world of light and speech, and I shall take leave to tell you that you are very dear."}
{"inputs": "What are the chances you’d ever meet someone like that? he wondered. Someone you could love forever, someone who would forever love you back? And what did you do when that person was born half a world away? The math seemed impossible."}
{"inputs": "That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. Most people love you for who you pretend to be. To keep their love, you keep pretending - performing. You get to love your pretence. It's true, we're locked in an image, an act - and the sad thing is, people get so used to their image, they grow attached to their masks. They love their chains. They forget all about who they really are. And if you try to remind them, they hate you for it, they feel like you're trying to steal their most precious possession."}
{"inputs": "I wonder if fears ever really go away, or if they just lose their power over us."}
{"inputs": "In desperate love, we always invent the characters of our partners, demanding they be what we need of them, and then feeling devastated when they refuse to perform the role we created in the first place."}

{"inputs": "There is always something left to love."}
{"inputs": "We must love one another or die"}
{"inputs": "It happens like this. One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel more connected to this stranger than anyone else--closer to them than your closest family. Perhaps this person carries within them an angel--one sent to you for some higher purpose; to teach you an important lesson or to keep you safe during a perilous time. What you must do is trust in them--even if they come hand in hand with pain or suffering--the reason for their presence will become clear in due time. Though here is a word of warning--you may grow to love this person but remember they are not yours to keep. Their purpose isn't to save you but to show you how to save yourself. And once this is fulfilled; the halo lifts and the angel leaves their body as the person exits your life. They will be a stranger to you once more.-------------------------------------------------It's so dark right now, I can't see any light around me. That's because the light is coming from you. You can't see it but everyone else can."}
{"inputs": "You say you love rain, but you use an umbrella to walk under it. You say you love sun, but you seek shelter when it is shining. You say you love wind, but when it comes you close your windows. So that's why I'm scared when you say you love me."}
{"inputs": "If a thing loves, it is infinite."}
{"inputs": "I'm lonely. Why do you think I had to learn to act so independent? I also get mad too quickly, and I hog the covers, and my second toe is longer than my big one. My hair has it's own zip code. Plus, I get certifiably crazy when I've got PMS. You don't love someone because they're perfect. You love them in spite of the fact that they're not."}

{"inputs": "He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs."}

{"inputs": "The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved -- loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves."}
{"inputs": "She didn't understand that. How can anyone be afraid of love? How can they not? His face was completely aghast. When you love someone... truly love them, friend or lover, you lay your heart open to them. You give them a part of yourself that you give to no one else, and you let them inside a part of you that only they can hurt—you literally hand them the razor with a map of where to cut deepest and most painfully on your heart and soul. And when they do strike, it's crippling—like having your heart carved out. It leaves you naked and exposed, wondering what you did to make them want to hurt you so badly when all you did was love them. What is so wrong with you that no one can keep faith with you? That no one can love you? To have it happen once is bad enough... but to have it repeated? Who in their right mind would not be terrified of that? "}
{"inputs": "Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. Love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves it's own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever."}

{"inputs": "They say a good love is one that sits you down, gives you a drink of water, and pats you on top of the head. But I say a good love is one that casts you into the wind, sets you ablaze, makes you burn through the skies and ignite the night like a phoenix; the kind that cuts you loose like a wildfire and you can't stop running simply because you keep on burning everything that you touch! I say that's a good love; one that burns and flies, and you run with it! "}
{"inputs": "He made a sound like a choked laughed before he reached out and pulled her into her arms. She was aware of Luke watching them from the window, but she shut her eyes resolutely and buried her face against Jace's shoulder. He smelled of salt and blood, and only when his mouth came close to her ear did she understand what he was saying, and it was the simplest litany of all: her name, just her name."}
{"inputs": "People always fall in love with the most perfect aspects of each other’s personalities. Who wouldn’t? Anybody can love the most wonderful parts of another person. But that’s not the clever trick. The really clever trick is this: Can you accept the flaws? Can you look at your partner’s faults honestly and say, ‘I can work around that. I can make something out of it.’? Because the good stuff is always going to be there, and it’s always going to pretty and sparkly, but the crap underneath can ruin you."}

I only did because you were here. He wrapped his arms around me, and I buried my face in his chest. I can't do it by myself, I whispered. You can, he said. There was a tremulous note in his voice. You're strong—you're so, so strong. It's why I love you."}

Seriously. How long have you been going out? Sam let go of my hands to get his wallet and took out some bills. Six years.I wrinkled my nose to cover a laugh. Of course he would count the time that we’d been two entirely different species.Whoa. Counter girl nodded appreciatively. That’s pretty amazing for a couple your age. Sam handed me my hot chocolate and didn’t answer. But his yellow eyes gazed at me possessively—I wondered if he realized that the way he looked at me was far more intimate than copping a feel could ever be.I crouched to look at the almond bark on the bottom shelf in the counter. I wasn’t quite bold enough to look at either of them when I admitted, Well, it was love at first sight.The girl sighed. That is just so romantic. Do me a favor, and don’t you two ever change. The world needs more love at first sight."}
{"inputs": "The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you."}
{"inputs": "You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose."}
{"inputs": "To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect."}

{"inputs": "Oh no. Don't smile. You'll kill me. I stop breathing when you smile."}
{"inputs": "Real isn't how you are made, ' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.''Does it hurt? ' asked the Rabbit. 'Sometimes, ' said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. 'When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.' 'Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, ' he asked, 'or bit by bit? ' 'It doesn't happen all at once, ' said the Skin Horse. 'You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."}
{"inputs": "The greatest disease in the West today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. The poverty in the West is a different kind of poverty -- it is not only a poverty of loneliness but also of spirituality. There's a hunger for love, as there is a hunger for God."}

{"inputs": "I don't want to lose you.' His voice almost a whisper. Seeing his haggard expression, she took his hand and squeezed it, then reluctantly let it go. She could feel the tears again, and she fought them back. 'But you don't want to keep me, either, do you? ' To that, he had no response."}
{"inputs": "If a girl starts out all casual with a guy and she doesn't tell him that she wants a relationship, it will never become a relationship. If you give the guy the impression that casual is okay with you, that's all he'll ever want. Be straight with him from the start. If he gets scared and runs away, he wasn't right for you."}

{"inputs": "Unless you love someone, nothing else makes sense."}
{"inputs": "I want morning and noon and nightfall with you. I want your tears, your smiles, your kisses...the smell of your hair, the taste of your skin, the touch of your breath on my face. I want to see you in the final hour of my life...to lie in your arms as I take my last breath."}

{"inputs": "Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."}
{"inputs": "It's so curious: one can resist tears and 'behave' very well in the hardest hours of grief. But then someone makes you a friendly sign behind a window, or one notices that a flower that was in bud only yesterday has suddenly blossomed, or a letter slips from a drawer... and everything collapses.

{"inputs": "I will find you, he whispered in my ear. I promise. If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you - then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes. For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust. But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance. When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest. His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God! I loved her well."}

{"inputs": "I don’t know what they are called, the spaces between seconds– but I think of you always in those intervals."}
{"inputs": "Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."}
{"inputs": "Love sucks. Sometimes it feels good. Sometimes it's just another way to bleed."}
{"inputs": "I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me."}
{"inputs": "To him she seemed so beautiful, so seductive, so different from ordinary people, that he could not understand why no one was as disturbed as he by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones, why no one else's heart was wild with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils, why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid, the flight of her hands, the gold of her laughter. He had not missed a single one of her gestures, not one of the indications of her character, but he did not dare approach her for fear of destroying the spell."}

{"inputs": "Perhaps, after all, romance did not come into one’s life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down; perhaps it crept to one’s side like an old friend through quiet ways; perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music, perhaps . . . perhaps . . . love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath."}
{"inputs": "You really love her don't you, she said.With all my heart. She looked as sad as I'd ever seen her.What's your heart telling you to do? I don't know. Maybe , she said gently, You're trying to hard to hear it."}
{"inputs": "You have a... remarkable memory. I remember everything about you. You're the one who wasn't paying attention."}
{"inputs": "We always see our worst selves. Our most vulnerable selves. We need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong. Someone we trust."}
{"inputs": "Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if oyu planned on fallin gin love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}

{"inputs": "The day the power of love overrules the love of power, the world will know peace."}
{"inputs": "Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or--such is the pleasure they experience--they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them."}
{"inputs": "Those sweet lips. My, oh my, I could kiss those lips all night long.Good things come to those who wait."}
{"inputs": "Love is the ultimate outlaw. It just won't adhere to any rules. The most any of us can do is to sign on as its accomplice. Instead of vowing to honor and obey, maybe we should swear to aid and abet. That would mean that security is out of the question. The words make and stay become inappropriate. My love for you has no strings attached. I love you for free."}
{"inputs": "My mother... she is beautiful, softened at the edges and tempered with a spine of steel. I want to grow old and be like her."}
{"inputs": "I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being."}
{"inputs": "Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it."}

{"inputs": "We could do it, you know. What? Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it."}
{"inputs": "It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love."}
{"inputs": "My sister will die over and over again for the rest of my life. Grief is forever. It doesn't go away; it becomes a part of you, step for step, breath for breath. I will never stop grieving Bailey because I will never stop loving her. That's just how it is. Grief and love are conjoined, you don't get one without the other. All I can do is love her, and love the world, emulate her by living with daring and spirit and joy."}
{"inputs": "This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible. And when it’s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be."}
{"inputs": "Parents were the only ones obligated to love you from the rest of the world you had to earn it."}
{"inputs": "Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved."}

Not just lustful petting but transcendental metamorphosis when you became aware that the greatness of this being was breathing into you. Licking the sides and corners of your mouth, like sealing a thousand fleshy envelopes filled with the essence of your passionate being and then opened by the same mouth and delivered back to you, over and over again - the first kiss of the rest of your life. A kiss that confirms that the universe is aligned, that the world's greatest resource is love, and maybe even that God is a woman. With or without a belief in God, all kisses are metaphors decipherable by allocations of time, circumstance, and understanding"}

{"inputs": "And it came to me then. That we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than lonely lumps of metal in their own separate orbits. From far off they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment. In the next instant we'd be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up and became nothing."}
{"inputs": "What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate, and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone's jokes?

One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky. She's drunk, Joe Bell informed me. Moderately, Holly confessed....Holly lifted her martini. Let's wish the Doc luck, too, she said, touching her glass against mine. Good luck: and believe me, dearest Doc -- it's better to look at the sky than live there. Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes and things disappear."}

He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you were my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out.

{"inputs": "One thing I do know about intimacy is that there are certain natural laws which govern the sexual experience of two people, and that these laws cannot be budged any more than gravity can be negotiated with. To feel physically comfortable with someone else's body is not a decision you can make. It has very little to do with how two people think or act or talk or even look. The mysterious magnet is either there, buried somewhere deep behind the sternum, or it is not. When it isn't there (as I have learned in the past, with heartbreaking clarity) you can no more force it to exist than a surgeon can force a patient's body to accept a kidney from the wrong donor. My friend Annie says it all comes down to one simple question: Do you want your belly pressed against this person's belly forever --or not? "}

{"inputs": "How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realize that to you it was only an episode."}
{"inputs": "We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we love ourselves.Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare."}
{"inputs": "Let us begin this letter, this prelude to an encounter, formally, as a declaration, in the old-fashioned way: I love you. You do not know me (although you have seen me, smiled at me). I know you (although not so well as I would like. I want to be there when your eyes flutter open in the morning, and you see me, and you smile. Surely this would be paradise enough? ).

How can you say you love one person when there are ten thousand people in the world that you would love more if you ever met them? But you'll never meet them. All right, so we do the best we can. Granted. But we must still realize that love is just the result of a chance encounter. Most people make too much of it. On these grounds a good fuck is not to be entirely scorned. But that's the result of a chance meeting too. You're damned right. Drink up. We'll have another."}

What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will did it. I have no broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live?

I'm going to be the first. He took my palm and held it to his. Swear it. Why me? Because you're the reason. Swear it. I swear it, I said, lost in the high color of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes. I swear it, he echoed.We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned. I feel like I could eat the world raw."}

Simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. But Jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was."}

Doesn't he know my heart belongs to you? It does not. And no, he's still worried about it, despite what I've told him. You know, I bet if we started making out right now, it would make him feel better. If you touch me, I said pleasantly, I'll provide you with the opportunity to see if you can heal yourself.

{"inputs": "When you love someone you let them take care of you."}
{"inputs": "I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you."}

{"inputs": "When You Are Old WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true, But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face; And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars."}
{"inputs": "After all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn't bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it's a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it's sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we're doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony."}
{"inputs": "One day, when I am a braver man, I will tell her these things, and then I will look her in the eye tell her I love her and ask her to be only mine. But until that day, we're just friends."}
{"inputs": "This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet."}

{"inputs": "Eventually something you love is going to be taken away. And then you will fall to the floor crying. And then, however much later, it is finally happening to you: you’re falling to the floor crying thinking, I am falling to the floor crying, but there’s an element of the ridiculous to it — you knew it would happen and, even worse, while you’re on the floor crying you look at the place where the wall meets the floor and you realize you didn’t paint it very well."}

{"inputs": "nothing in this world was more difficult than love."}

{"inputs": "If I am to be fallen into love, I will. And if as a result I will appear to be stupid, disillusioned, and of poor judgment, I will. And I would be damned if I cared what other people think. For I would rather be thought of as all of these things, than not love. If in loving, I become the naked woman on the horse, I will ride that horse with my head held high. This is my spirit. I am unbreakable."}
{"inputs": "Someday, we’ll run into each other again, I know it.Maybe I’ll be older and smarter and just plain better. If that happens, that’s when I’ll deserve you. But now, at this moment, you can’t hook your boat to mine, because I’m liable to sink us both."}

{"inputs": "I know you're tired but come, this is the way."}
{"inputs": "To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love. But then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to suffer; to suffer is to suffer.

{"inputs": "Maybe the first time you saw her you were ten. She was standing in the sun scratching her legs. Or tracing letters in the dirt with a stick. Her hair was being pulled. Or she was pulling someone's hair. And a part of you was drawn to her, and a part of you resisted--wanting to ride off on your bicycle, kick a stone, remain uncomplicated. In the same breath you felt the strength of a man, and a self-pity that made you feel small and hurt. Part of you thought: Please don't look at me. If you don't, I can still turn away. And part of you thought: Look at me."}
{"inputs": "We kiss all the time. I clear my throat, then add, We just...do it in private. A smug expression crosses his face.

{"inputs": "Because I can't help doing it, he said with a shrug. And hey, if I keep loving you, maybe you'll eventually crack and love me too. Hell, I'm pretty sure you're already half in love with me. I am not! And everything you just said is ridiculous. That's terrible logic. Adrian returned to his crossword puzzle. Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember-no matter how ordinary things seem between us-I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will.

{"inputs": "Yes, I decided, a man can truly change. The events of the past year have taught me much about myself, and a few universal truths. I learned, for instance, that while wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it's often much more difficult to heal them. Yet the process of healing those wounds provided the richest experience of my life, leading me to believe that while I've often overestimated what I could accomplish in a day, I had underestimated what I could do in a year. But most of all, I learned that it's possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there's been a lifetime of disappointment between them."}

Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane? I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still. Because, he said, I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you - especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous channel, and two hundred miles or so of land some broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you'd forget me."}

{"inputs": "Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says, Love your enemies. It is this: that love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. Just keep being friendly to that person. Just keep loving them, and they can’t stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they’ll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And by the power of your love they will break down under the load. That’s love, you see. It is redemptive, and this is why Jesus says love. There’s something about love that builds up and is creative. There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive. So love your enemies. (from Loving Your Enemies )"}

And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve.

They made up a thousand games. She was queen and he was king. In the autumn light her hair shone like a crown. They collected the world in small handfuls, and when the sky grew dark, and they parted with leaves in their hair.Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."}

{"inputs": "It’s important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences. You have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too. Nurture your mind with positive thoughts: kindness, empathy, compassion, peace, love, joy, humility, generosity, etc. The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life."}
{"inputs": "Last time I saw you, I said that it hurt too much to love you. But I was wrong about that. The truth is it hurts too much not to love you."}
{"inputs": "To love is to recognize yourself in another."}
{"inputs": "Yes... it wasn't over, it still isn't over."}
{"inputs": "I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he loves me."}
{"inputs": "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sightFor the ends of being and ideal grace.I love thee to the level of every day'sMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.I love thee freely, as men strive for right.I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.I love thee with the passion put to useIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.I love thee with a love I seemed to loseWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."}
{"inputs": "You can live your whole life not realizing that what you're looking for is right in front of you."}
{"inputs": "It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters, "}
{"inputs": "To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God."}
{"inputs": "When you love you wish to do things for. You wish to sacrifice for. You wish to serve."}
{"inputs": "That's when I finally got it. I finally understood. It wasn't the thought that counted. It was the actual execution that mattered, the showing up for somebody. The intent behind it wasn't enough. Not for me. Not anymore. It wasn't enough to know that deep down, he loved me. You had to actually say it to somebody, show them you cared. And he just didn't. Not enough."}
{"inputs": "Oh, love isn't there to make us happy. I believe it exists to show us how much we can endure."}
{"inputs": "It starts so young, and I'm angry about that. The garbage we're taught. About love, about what's romantic. Look at so many of the so-called romantic figures in books and movies. Do we ever stop and think how many of them would cause serious and drastic unhappiness after The End? Why are sick and dangerous personality types so often shown a passionate and tragic and something to be longed for when those are the very ones you should run for your life from? Think about it. Heathcliff. Romeo. Don Juan. Jay Gatsby. Rochester. Mr. Darcy. From the rigid control freak in The Sound of Music to all the bad boys some woman goes running to the airport to catch in the last minute of every romantic comedy. She should let him leave. Your time is so valuable, and look at these guys--depressive and moody and violent and immature and self-centered. And what about the big daddy of them all, Prince Charming? What was his secret life? We dont know anything about him, other then he looks good and comes to the rescue."}
{"inputs": "You had to know a person well to make them laugh like that."}
{"inputs": "Desiring another person is perhaps the most risky endeavor of all. As soon as you want somebody—really want him—it is as though you have taken a surgical needle and sutured your happiness to the skin of that person, so that any separation will now cause a lacerating injury."}
{"inputs": "A busy, vibrant, goal-oriented woman is so much more attractive than a woman who waits around for a man to validate her existence."}
{"inputs": "How do you know when it's over? Maybe when you feel more in love with your memories than with the person standing in front of you."}

{"inputs": "If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it."}
{"inputs": "Down on the lake rosy reflections of celestial vapor appeared, and I said, God, I love you and looked to the sky and really meant it. I have fallen in love with you, God. Take care of us all, one way or the other. To the children and the innocent it's all the same."}
{"inputs": "You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too."}
{"inputs": "And I can fight only for something that I love, love only what I respect, and respect only what I at least know."}
{"inputs": "The truest form of love is how you behave toward someone, not how you feel about them."}
{"inputs": "I go to sleep alone, and wake up alone. I take walks. I work until I'm tired. I watch the wind play with the trash that's been under the snow all winter. Everything seems simple until you think about it. Why is love intensified by abscence? "}
{"inputs": "The fact is…I’m in love with you, and I have been for some time."}
{"inputs": "He sighed and then focused his eyes right on me. It was like drowning, drowning in seas of green. There was nothing in the world except for those eyes. I want to kiss you, Rose, he said softly. And I want you to want me too."}
{"inputs": "Anne laughed. I don't want sunbursts or marble halls, I just want you."}
{"inputs": "There's always a moment when you start to fall out of love, whether it's with a person or an idea or a cause, even if it's one you only narrate to yourself years after the event: a tiny thing, a wrong word, a false note, which means that things can never be quite the same again."}
{"inputs": "If I love you, I will carry for you all your pain, I will assume for you all your debts (in every definition of the word), I will protect you from your own insecurity, I will protect upon you all sorts of good qualities that you have never actually cultivated in yourself and I will buy Christmas presents for your entire family. I will give you the sun and the rain, and if they are not available, I will give you a sun check and a rain check. I will give you all this and more, until I get so exhausted and depleted that the only way I can recover my energy is by becoming infatuated with someone else."}
{"inputs": "I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are there, in everything I am, in everything I've ever done, and looking back, I know that I should have told you know much you've always meant to me. "}
{"inputs": "I'm the kind of boy that can fall in love with any girl because I love with the heart, not the eyes."}
{"inputs": "I want you any way I can get you. Not because you’re beautiful or clever or kind or adorable, although devil knows you’re all those things. I want you because there’s no one else like you, and I don’t ever want to start a day without seeing you."}
{"inputs": "I feel good with my husband: I like his warmth and his bigness and his being-there and his making and his jokes and stories and what he reads and how he likes fishing and walks and pigs and foxes and little animals and is honest and not vain or fame-crazy and how he shows his gladness for what I cook him and joy for when I make him something, a poem or a cake, and how he is troubled when I am unhappy and wants to do anything so I can fight out my soul-battles and grow up with courage and a philosophical ease. I love his good smell and his body that fits with mine as if they were made in the same body-shop to do just that. What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my husband. So I don't want to look around any more: I don't need to look around for anything."}
{"inputs": "No, it's not that. It's not what you're thinking. I was serious when I said 'all of it'. I can remember every moment we were together, and in eachof them there was something wonderful. I can't really pick any one time that meant more than any other. The entire summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone should have. How could I pick one moment over another? Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."}
{"inputs": "Any happiness, no matter how brief, seemed better than the long, simmering torture of waking up day after day, knowing I could never have him."}
{"inputs": "But maybe you never really had someone, she thought now. Maybe, no matter how much you loved them, they could slip through your fingers like water, and there was nothing you could do about it."}
{"inputs": "If having a soul means being able to feel love and loyalty and gratitude, then animals are better off than a lot of humans."}
{"inputs": "Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring."}
{"inputs": "So much of the language of love was like that: you devoured someone with your eyes, you drank in the sight of him, you swallowed him whole. Love was substance, broken down and beating through your bloodstream."}
{"inputs": "Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection."}
{"inputs": "Just because I'm not forever by your side doesn't mean that's not precisely where I want to be."}
{"inputs": "Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex, or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him."}
{"inputs": "If a man hasn't what's necessary to make a woman love him, it's his fault, not hers."}
{"inputs": "She's my kitten, and no one else's."}
{"inputs": "Work without love is slavery."}
{"inputs": "Love is where you find it. I think it is foolish to go around looking for it, and I think it can be poisonous. I wish that people who are conventionally supposed to love each other would say to each other, when they fight, 'Please — a little less love, and a little more common decency'."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than I hate everything else."}
{"inputs": "Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away, and he could not find it."}
{"inputs": "Love, like fire, goes out without fuel."}
{"inputs": "One thing: you have to walk, and create the way by your walking; you will not find a ready-made path. It is not so cheap, to reach to the ultimate realization of truth. You will have to create the path by walking yourself; the path is not ready-made, lying there and waiting for you. It is just like the sky: the birds fly, but they don't leave any footprints. You cannot follow them; there are no footprints left behind."}
{"inputs": "Love, when spelled backwards and read phonetically, reads evil"}
{"inputs": "I threw myself into that fire, threw myself into it, into him, and let myself burn."}
{"inputs": "Wait a second, Four says. I turn toward him, wondering which version of Four I'll see now-the one who scolds me, or the one who climbs Ferris wheels with me. He smiles a little, but the smile doesn't spread to his eyes, which look less tense and worried. You belong here, you know that? he says. You belong with us. It'll be over soon, so just hold on, okay? He scratches behind his ear and looks away, like he's embarrassed by what he said. I stare at him. I feel my heartbeat everywhere, even in my toes. I feel like doing something bold, but I could just as easily walk away. I am not sure which option is smarter, or better. I am not sure that I care.I reach out and take his hand. His fingers slide between mine. I can't breathe. I stare up at him, and he stares down at me. For a long moment, we stay that way. Then I pull my hand away and run after Uriah and Lynn and Marlene. Maybe now he thinks I'm stupid, or strange. Maybe it was worth it."}
{"inputs": "If somebody says 'I love you' to me, I feel as though I had a pistol pointed at my head. What can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol holder requires? 'I love you, too'."}
{"inputs": "He wasn't the type for displays of affection, either verbal or not. He was disgusted by couples that made out in the hallways between classes, and got annoyed at even the slightest sappy moments in movies. But I knew he cared about me: he just conveyed it more subtly, as concise with expressing this emotion as he was with everything else. It was in the way he'd put his hand on the small of my back, for instance, or how he'd smile at me when I said something that surprised him. Once I might have wanted more, but I'd come around to his way of thinking in the time we'd been together. And we were together, all the time. So he didn't have to prove how he felt about me. Like so much else, I should just know."}
{"inputs": "Marry me, Kiara, he blurts out in front of everyone.Why? she asks, challenging him.Because I love you, he says, walking up to her and bending down on one knee while he takes her hand in his, and I want to go to sleep with you every night and wake up seein’ your face every mornin’, I want you to be the mother of my children, I want to fix cars with you and eat your crappy tofu tacos that you think are Mexican. I want to climb mountains with you and be challenged by you, I want to argue with you just so we can have crazy hot makeup sex. Marry me, because without you I’d be six feet under … and because I love your family like they’re my own … and because you’re my best friend and I want to grow old with you. He starts tearing up, and it’s shocking because I’ve never seen him cry. Marry me, Kiara Westford, because when I got shot the only thing I was thinkin’ about was comin’ back here and makin’ you my wife. Say yes, chica."}
{"inputs": "But you're the only one, Scarlet. You'll always be the only one."}
{"inputs": "I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men. Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything."}

{"inputs": "Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely. God is love, they once said, but we reversed that, and love, like heaven, was always just around the corner. The more difficult it was to love the particular man beside us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and total. We were waiting, always, for the incarnation. That word, made flesh.And sometimes it happened, for a time. That kind of love comes and goes and is hard to remember afterwards, like pain. You would look at the man one day and you would think, I loved you, and the tense would be past, and you would be filled with a sense of wonder, because it was such an amazing and precarious and dumb thing to have done; and you would know too why your friends had been evasive about it, at the time.There is a good deal of comfort, now, in remembering this."}
{"inputs": "If you love deeply, you're going to get hurt badly. But it's still worth it."}
{"inputs": "Statistically speaking, there is a 65 percent chance that the love of your life is having an affair. Be very suspicious."}
{"inputs": "Through my love for you, I want to express my love for the whole cosmos, the whole of humanity, and all beings. By living with you, I want to learn to love everyone and all species. If I succeed in loving you, I will be able to love everyone and all species on Earth... This is the real message of love."}

{"inputs": "There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it."}
{"inputs": "Transformation is my favorite game and in my experience, anger and frustration are the result of you not being authentic somewhere in your life or with someone in your life. Being fake about anything creates a block inside of you. Life can’t work for you if you don’t show up as you."}
{"inputs": "And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire."}
{"inputs": "The only obsession everyone wants: 'love.' People think that in falling in love they make themselves whole? The Platonic union of souls? I think otherwise. I think you're whole before you begin. And the love fractures you. You're whole, and then you're cracked open. "}
{"inputs": "Often it is the most deserving people who cannot help loving those who destroy them."}
{"inputs": "Love like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive."}
{"inputs": "You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That’s where I’ll always love you. That’s where I’ll be waiting."}
{"inputs": "Now I'd rather be infected with love for the tiniest sliver of a second than live a hundred years smothered by a lie."}
{"inputs": "After all, damn it, what does being in love mean if you can't trust a person."}
{"inputs": "If you’re smart, you care. And if you care, you love."}
{"inputs": "Love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable."}
{"inputs": "Love consists of not looking each other in the eye, but of looking outwardly in the same direction."}
{"inputs": "If you send out goodness from yourself, or if you share that which is happy or good within you, it will all come back to you multiplied ten thousand times. In the kingdom of love there is no competition; there is no possessiveness or control. The more love you give away, the more love you will have."}
{"inputs": "And in the end, we were all just humans.. drunk on the idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness."}
{"inputs": "Never give all the heart, for loveWill hardly seem worth thinking ofTo passionate women if it seemCertain, and they never dreamThat it fades out from kiss to kiss;For everything that's lovely isBut a brief, dreamy, kind delight.O Never give the heart outright, For they, for all smooth lips can say, Have given their hearts up to the play.And who could play it well enoughIf deaf and dumb and blind with love? He that made this knows all the cost, For he gave all his heart and lost."}
{"inputs": "You can obsess and obsess over how things ended—what you did wrong or could have done differently—but there's not much of a point. It's not like it'll change anything. So really, why worry? "}
{"inputs": "You asked why I couldn't forgive you, Nick said, very quietly, and I jumped a little. It was because you were the love of my life, Harper. And you didn't want to be. That's hard to let go."}
{"inputs": "The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."}
{"inputs": "Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."}
{"inputs": "Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good."}
{"inputs": "There is nothing on earth more beautiful to me than your smile...no sound sweeter than your laughter...no pleasure greater than holding you in my arms.

{"inputs": "She hardly ever thought of him. He had worn a place for himself in some corner of her heart, as a sea shell, always boring against the rock, might do. The making of the place had been her pain. But now the shell was safely in the rock. It was lodged, and ground no longer."}
{"inputs": "Being with her I feel a pain, like a frozen knife stuck in my chest. An awful pain, but the funny thing is I'm thankful for it. It's like that frozen pain and my very existence are one."}
{"inputs": "Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear."}
{"inputs": "I don't care if you say we can't be together. I don't care if you think I'm the most evil, unnatural creature walking on earth. You can think whatever you want, go whatever you want. I'm going to just go on loving you, even if it's hopeless."}
{"inputs": "You're a hero and a gentleman, you're kind and honest, but more than that, you're the first man I ever truly loved. And no matter what the future brings, you always will be, and I know that my life is better for it."}

{"inputs": "I have learned that you can go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do and buy all the things that you want to buy and meet all the people that you want to meet and learn all the things that you desire to learn and if you do all these things but are not madly in love: you have still not begun to live."}
{"inputs": "And now, Eric yelled into his mircophone, we're going to sing a new song-one we just wrote. This one's for my girlfriend. We've been going out for three weeks, and, damn, our love is true. We're gonna be together forever, baby. This one's called 'Bang You Like a Drum."}
{"inputs": "It is a defect of God's humor that he directs our hearts everywhere but to those who have a right to them."}
{"inputs": "That's why I loved being with you. We could do the simplest things, like toss starfish into the ocean and share a burger and talk and even then I knew that I was fortunate. Because you were the first guy who wasn't constantly trying to impress me. You accepted who you were, but more than that, you accepted me for me. And nothing else mattered-- not my family or your family or anyone else in the world. It was just us."}
{"inputs": "The minute I stopped trying to find the right girl, and started trying to become the right guy...the girl came."}

{"inputs": "When you drop a glass or a plate to the ground it makes a loud crashing sound. When a window shatters a table leg breaks or when a picture falls off the wall it makes a noise. But as for your heart when that breaks it s completely silent. You would think as it s so important it would make the loudest noise in the whole world or even have some ... Read Moresort of ceremonious sound like the gong of a cymbal or the ringing of a bell. But it s silent and you almost wish there was a noise to distract you from the pain. If there is a noise it s internal. It screams and no one can hear it but you. It screams so loud your ears ring and your head aches. It trashes around in your chest like a great white shark caught in the sea it roars like a mother bear whose cub has been taken. That s what it looks like and that s what it sounds like a trashing panicking trapped great big beast roaring like a prisoner to its own emotions. But that s the thing about love no one is untouchable."}

{"inputs": "Everybody is a main character to someone..."}
{"inputs": "He was not my boyfriend. On the other hand, he wasn't just a friend either. Instead, our relationship was elastic, stretching between those two extremes depending on who else was around, how much either of us had to drink, and other varying factors. This was exactly what I wanted, as commitments had never really been my thing. And it wasn't like it was hard, either. The only trick was never giving more than you were willing to lose."}
{"inputs": "A true gentleman is one that apologizes anyways, even though he has not offended a lady intentionally. He is in a class all of his own because he knows the value of a woman's heart."}
{"inputs": "They send a person who can never stay, she whispered. Who can never accept my offer of companionship for more than a little while. They send me a hero I can't help ... just the sort of person I can't help falling in love with. ...As I sailed into the lake I realized the Fates really were cruel. They sent Calypso someone she couldn't help but love. But it worked both ways. For the rest of my life I would be thinking about her. She would always be my biggest what if."}
{"inputs": "You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say."}
{"inputs": "I think in the end, you would have stayed with me, out of obligation...or maybe comfort. Maybe I was safe to you, and you needed to feel that. I know how scared you get of the unknown. To you...I must be kind of a security blanket. Do you see now, how that doesn't work for me? I don't want to be there, simply because the idea of me being gone is too...scary. I want to be someone's everything. I want fire and passion, and love that's returned, equally. I want to be someone's heart... Even if it means breaking my own."}
{"inputs": "Love one another, but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn't mean anything if you're not willing to make a commitment, and you have to think not only about what you want, but about what he wants. Not just now, but in the future."}

{"inputs": "His hands lay flat on either side of him, his arms at his sides. He seemed barely to be breathing; she wasn't sure she was breathing herself. She slid her own hand across the bedsheet, just far enough that their fingers touched-so lightly that she would have probably hardly been aware of it had she been touching anyone but Jace; as it was, the nerve endings in her fingertips pricked softly, as if she were holding them over a low flame. She felt him tense beside her and then relax. He had shut his eyes, and his lashes cast fine shadows against the curve of his cheekbones. His mouth curled into a smile as if he sensed her watching him, and she wondered how he would look in the morning, with his hair messed and sleep circles under his eyes. Despite everything, the thought gave her a jolt of happiness.She laced her fingers through his. Good night, she whispered. With their hands clasped like children in a fairy tale, she fell asleep beside him in the dark."}

{"inputs": "Time will make it worse! You're...the other half of his soul. He's never going to get over you. And no matter how much you hope that you will... you'll never get over him. You're going to wake up one day and realize what you've done, and you're going to regret the time you wasted apart from him for the rest of your life."}
{"inputs": "It may be important to great thinkers to examine the world, to explain and despise it. But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for us to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect."}
{"inputs": "Why are you leaving me? He wrote, I do not know how to live.I do not know either but I am trying.I do not know how to try.There were some things I wanted to tell him. But I knew they would hurt him. So i buried them and let them hurt me"}
{"inputs": "And I, infinitesima­l being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, I felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke loose on the wind."}

{"inputs": "Sometimes people don’t understandthe promises they’re making when they make them, I said.Isaac shot me a look. Right, of course.But you keep the promise anyway. That’swhat love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway. Don’t you believe in true love? "}
{"inputs": "Tonight was... well, it was perfect for me too. You've turned my world upside down. I've fallen in love with you, chica, and it scares the fuckin' shit outta me. I've been shakin' all night, because I knew it.I've tried to deny it, to make you think I wanted you as a fake girlfriend, but that was a lie."}
{"inputs": "Love's about finding the one person who makes your heart complete. Who makes you a better person than you ever dreamed you could be. Its about looking in the eyes of your wife and knowing all the way to your bones that she's simply the best person you've ever known."}

{"inputs": "When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already."}
{"inputs": "I feel like a part of my soul has loved you since the beginning of everything.Maybe we’re from the same star."}
{"inputs": "He loved her for almost everything she was & she decided that was enough to let him stay for a very long time."}

{"inputs": "Make me into anything, but just love me."}
{"inputs": "Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love."}
{"inputs": "To the people who love you, you are beautiful already. This is not because they’re blind to your shortcomings but because they so clearly see your soul. Your shortcomings then dim by comparison. The people who care about you are willing to let you be imperfect and beautiful, too. (20)"}

{"inputs": "This time when we kiss, I feel it in the pit of my stomach, I feel it in my heart. And I realize love isn't about sex. It's about connection."}
{"inputs": "If you love someone but rarely make yourself available to him or her, that is not true love."}
{"inputs": "What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, I have forgotten, and what arms have lainUnder my head till morning, but the rainIs full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sighUpon the glass and listen for reply, And in my heart there stirs a quiet painFor unremembered lads that not againWill turn to me at midnight with a cry.Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree, Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:I cannot say what loves have come and gone, I only know that summer sang in meA little while, that in me sings no more."}
{"inputs": "Every time we make the decision to love someone, we open ourselves to great suffering, because those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain. The greatest pain comes from leaving. When the child leaves home, when the husband or wife leaves for a long period of time or for good, when the beloved friend departs to another country or dies … the pain of the leaving can tear us apart.Still, if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving, we will never experience the joy of loving. And love is stronger than fear, life stronger than death, hope stronger than despair. We have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking."}
{"inputs": "The way you're singing in your sleepThe way you look before you leapThe strange illusions that you keepYou don't knowBut I'm noticingThe way your touch turns into arcsThe way you slide into the darkThe beating of my open heartYou don't knowBut I'm noticing"}
{"inputs": "If you cannot inspire a woman with love of you, fill her above the brim with love of herself ~ all that runs over will be yours."}
{"inputs": "And yes, I’ll admit, I am jealous. I’m jealous of every minute you spend with him, of every concerned expression you send his way, of every tear shed, of every glance, every touch, and every thought. I want to rip him to pieces and purge him from your mind and from your heart. But I can’t."}
{"inputs": "Would you mind repeating that? I'm afraid I might have lost my wits altogether and just hallucinated what I've longed to hear."}
{"inputs": "Only the united beat of sex and heart together can create ecstasy."}
{"inputs": "Loving someone is giving them the power to break your heart, but trusting them not to."}
{"inputs": "What irritated me most in that entire situation was the fact that Iwasn’t feeling humiliated, or annoyed, or even fooled. Betrayal waswhat I felt, my heart broken not just by a guy I was in love with, butalso by, as I once believed, a true friend."}
{"inputs": "Autumn is the hardest season. The leaves are all falling, and they're falling likethey're falling in love with the ground."}
{"inputs": "Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, Tomorrow I'll miss you."}
{"inputs": "Things that matter are not easy. Feelings of happiness are easy. Happiness is not. Flirting is easy. Love is not. Saying you’re friends is easy. Being friends is not."}
{"inputs": "He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong."}
{"inputs": "The first time he'd held her hand, it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things. It felt better than anything had ever hurt."}
{"inputs": "That's how you know you love someone, I guess, when you can't experience anything without wishing the other person were there to see it, too."}
{"inputs": "One more secret smile. One more shared laugh. One more electric kiss. Finding him was like finding someone I didn't know I was searching for."}
{"inputs": "That's when you know for sure somebody loves you. They figure out what you need and they give it to you -- without you asking."}
{"inputs": "When you feel someone else's pain and joy as powerfully as if it were your own, then you know you really loved them."}

{"inputs": "... better to have loved and lost bullshit. Don't show me paradise and then burn it down."}

{"inputs": "Love is too precious to be ashamed of."}
{"inputs": "This I want to believe implicitly: Man was born for love and revolution."}
{"inputs": "I realized how truly hard it was, really, to see someone you love change right before your eyes. Not only is it scary, it throws your balance off as well."}
{"inputs": "Every widow wakes one morning, perhaps after years of pure and unwavering grieving, to realize she slept a good night's sleep, and will be able to eat breakfast, and doesn't hear her husband's ghost all the time, but only some of the time. Her grief is replaced with a useful sadness. Every parent who loses a child finds a way to laugh again. The timbre begins to fade. The edge dulls. The hurt lessens. Every love is carved from loss. Mine was. Yours is. Your great-great-great-grandchildren's will be. But we learn to live in that love."}
{"inputs": "I will not wait to love as best as I can. We thought we were young and that there would be time to love well sometime in the future. This is a terrible way to think. It is no way to live, to wait to love."}
{"inputs": "I am my heart’s undertaker. Daily I go and retrieve its tattered remains, place them delicately into its little coffin, and bury it in the depths of my memory, only to have to do it all again tomorrow."}
{"inputs": "The Court of Dreams.The people who knew that there was a price, and one worth paying, for that dream. The bastard- born warriors, the Illyrian half breed, the monster trapped in a beautiful body, the dreamer born into a court of nightmares...And the huntress with an artist's soul."}
{"inputs": "If I love you more than you love me, I’m as good as dead. Yet I can’t make myself take it back. I can’t just walk away from you, because every time you pass by me without smiling, without touching my hand, or at least making eye contact, it feels like I’m dying inside."}
{"inputs": "He was the toast to her butter."}
{"inputs": "She smiled, and her eyes started to drift downward. Cather... Back up to his eyes. You know that I'm falling in love with you, right? "}
{"inputs": "Like some wines our love could neither mature nor travel."}
{"inputs": "He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever."}
{"inputs": "...Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make love known? "}
{"inputs": "The heart can think of no devotionGreater than being shore to the ocean-Holding the curve of one position, Counting an endless repetition."}
{"inputs": "But even when I stop crying, even when we fall asleep and I'm nestled in his arms, this will leave another scar. No one will see it. No one will know. But it will be there. And eventually all of the scars will have scars, and that's all I'll be--one big scar of a love gone wrong."}
{"inputs": "So long as we love we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I would almost say that we are indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend."}
{"inputs": "Love is a striking example of how little reality means to us."}
{"inputs": "Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love."}
{"inputs": "Do you believe a man can truly love a woman and constantly betray her? Never mind physically but betray her in his mind, in the very poetry of his soul .Well, it's not easy but men do it all the time."}
{"inputs": "If you love me as you say you do, ' she whispered, 'make it so that I am at peace."}
{"inputs": "Love is not a habit, a commitment, or a debt. It isn't what romantic songs tell us it is - love simply is."}
{"inputs": "The more boys I meet the more I love my dog."}
{"inputs": "I hug him tightly. I can’t imagine my life without you, Christian. I love you so much it frightens me. Me, too, he breathes. My life would be empty without you. I love you so much."}
{"inputs": "We, unaccustomed to courageexiles from delightlive coiled in shells of lonelinessuntil love leaves its high holy templeand comes into our sightto liberate us into life.Love arrivesand in its train come ecstasiesold memories of pleasureancient histories of pain.Yet if we are bold, love strikes away the chains of fearfrom our souls.We are weaned from our timidityIn the flush of love's lightwe dare be braveAnd suddenly we seethat love costs all we areand will ever be.Yet it is only lovewhich sets us free."}

{"inputs": "I think you're still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me."}
{"inputs": "and when all the wars are over, a butterfly will still be beautiful."}

{"inputs": "Tears are words the heart can't express"}
{"inputs": "The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I love her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection."}
{"inputs": "Genuine love is rarely an emotional space where needs are instantly gratified. To know love we have to invest time and commitment...'dreaming that love will save us, solve all our problems or provide a steady state of bliss or security only keeps us stuck in wishful fantasy, undermining the real power of the love -- which is to transform us.' Many people want love to function like a drug, giving them an immediate and sustained high. They want to do nothing, just passively receive the good feeling."}
{"inputs": "I was glad I wasn't in love, that I wasn't happy with the world. I like being at odds with everything. People in love often become edgy, dangerous. They lose their sense of perspective. They lose their sense of humor. They become nervous, psychotic bores. They even become killers."}
{"inputs": "Shazi, I prefer the color blue to any other. The scent of lilacs in your hair is a source of constant torment. I despise figs. Lastly, I will never forget, all the days of my life, the memories of last night—For nothing, not the sun, not the rain, not even the brightest star in the darkest sky, could begin to compare to the wonder of you.Khalid."}
{"inputs": "I think you can only be truly mad at someone you really love."}
{"inputs": "Wanting him to come back before anyone notices part of the world has not moved since he left."}
{"inputs": "I wanted to tell her everything, maybe if I'd been able to, we could have lived differently, maybe I'd be there with you now instead of here. Maybe... if I'd said, 'I'm so afraid of losing something I love that I refuse to love anything, ' maybe that would have made the impossible possible. Maybe, but I couldn't do it, I had buried too much too deeply inside me. And here I am, instead of there."}
{"inputs": "Love is illogical, love had consequences--I did this to myself, and I should be able to take it."}
{"inputs": "Ultimately, it is the desire, not the desired, that we love."}
{"inputs": "Your naked body should only belong to those who fall in love with your naked soul."}
{"inputs": "I would love to saythat youmake meweak in the kneesbutto be quite upfrontand completelytruthfulyoumake my bodyforgetit has kneesat all."}
{"inputs": "Plant seeds of happiness, hope, success, and love; it will all come back to you in abundance. This is the law of nature."}
{"inputs": "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me, and I am in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men."}
{"inputs": "Love must not entreat, ' she added, 'or demand. Love must have the strength to become certain within itself. Then it ceases merely to be attracted and begins to attract."}
{"inputs": "Falling in love you remain a child; rising in love you mature. By and by love becomes not a relationship, it becomes a state of your being. Not that you are in love - now you are love."}
{"inputs": "I wish I had a boyfriend. I wish he lived in the wardrobe on a coat hanger. Whenever I wanted, I could get him out and he'd look at me the way boys do in films, as if I'm beautiful."}
{"inputs": "I don't remember who said this, but there really are places in the heart you don't even know exist until you love a child."}
{"inputs": "Last night I was seriously considering whether I was a bisexual or not but I don’t think so though I’m not sure if I’d like to be and argh I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, if you like a person, you like the person, not their genitals."}
{"inputs": "Every life has one true love snapshot."}
{"inputs": "Sweets to the sweet."}
{"inputs": "I half closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he'd wave, and maybe even call."}
{"inputs": "When you're missing a peice of yourself, aching, gut wrenching emptiness begins to take over. Until you find the link that completes your very soul, the feeling will never go away. Most people find a way to fill this void, material possessions, a string of relationships, affairs, food...I bare my soul, with words, for all to see."}
{"inputs": "Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night."}
{"inputs": "What greater thing is there for two human souls, than to feel that they are joined for life--to strengthen each other in all labor, to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting? "}
{"inputs": "If you simply ignored the feeling, you would never know what might happen, and in many ways that was worse than finding out in the first place. Because if you were wrong, you could go forward in your life without ever looking back over your shoulder and wondering what might have been."}
{"inputs": "But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise on your lips."}
{"inputs": "My head’ll explode if I continue with this escapism."}
{"inputs": "Oh lovers! be careful in those dangerous first days! once you've brought breakfast in bed you'll have to bring it forever, unless you want to be accused of lovelessness and betrayal."}
{"inputs": "Two words. Three vowels. Four constenants. Seven letters. It can either cut you open to the core and leave you in ungodly pain or it can free your soul and lift a tremendous weight off you shoulders. The phrase is: It's over."}
{"inputs": "There are many different types of kisses. There’s a passionate kiss of farewell—like the kind Rhett gave Scarlett when he went off to war. The kiss of I-can’t-really-be-with-you-but-I-want-to-be—like with Superman and Lois Lane. There’s the first kiss—one that is gentle and hesitant, warm and vulnerable. And then there’s the kiss of possession—which was how Ren kissed me now. It went beyond passion, beyond desire. His kiss was full of longing, need, and love, like all those other kisses. But, it was also filled with promises and pledges, some of which seemed sweet and tender while others seemed dangerous and exciting. He was taking me over. Staking a claim. He seized me as boldly as the tiger captured his prey. There was no escape. And I didn’t want to. I would have happily died in his clutches. I was his. And he made sure I knew it. My heart burst with a thousand beautiful blooms, all tiger lilies. And I knew with a certainty more powerful than anything I’d ever felt before that we belonged together. "}
{"inputs": "Everyone always wants to know how you can tell when it's true love, and the answer is this: when the pain doesn't fade and the scars don't heal, and it's too damned late."}
{"inputs": "If you aren't the woman I think you are, then this isn't the world I thought it was."}
{"inputs": "You who suffer because you love, love still more. To die of love, is to live by it."}
{"inputs": "There was beauty in the idea of freedom, but it was an illusion. Every human heart was chained by love."}
{"inputs": "As long as Man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings, he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love."}
{"inputs": "I won't telephone him. I'll never telephone him again as long as I live. He'll rot in hell, before I'll call him up. You don't have to give me strength, God; I have it myself. If he wanted me, he could get me. He knows where I am. He knows I'm waiting here. He's so sure of me, so sure. I wonder why they hate you, as soon as they are sure of you."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes two people have to fall apart, to realize how much they need to fall back together."}
{"inputs": "People always say that, when you love someone, nothing in the world matters. But that's not true, is it? You know, and I know, that when you love someone, everything in the world matters a little bit more."}
{"inputs": "Freely we serveBecause we freely love, as in our willTo love or not; in this we stand or fall."}
{"inputs": "When you find somebody you love, all the way through, and she loves you—even with your weaknesses, your flaws, everything starts to click into place. And if you can talk to her, and she listens, if she makes you laugh, and makes you think, makes you want, makes you see who you really are, and who you are is better, just better with her, you’d be crazy not to want to spend the rest of your life with her. (Carter Maguire)"}
{"inputs": "One of the most frustrating words in the human language, as far as I could tell, was love.So much meaning attached to this one little word. People bandied it about freely, using it todescribe their attachments to possessions, pets, vacation destinations, and favorite foods. In thesame breath they then applied this word to the person they considered most important in theirlives. Wasn’t that insulting? Shouldn’t there be some other term to describe deeper emotion? "}
{"inputs": "You can't own a human being. You can't lose what you don't own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don't, do you? And neither does he. You're turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can't value you more than you value yourself."}
{"inputs": "I just...I just miss him. And I hate being so alone."}
{"inputs": "We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."}
{"inputs": "I got my heart's desire, and there my troubles began."}
{"inputs": "I was dead, then alive.Weeping, then laughing.The power of love came into me, and I became fierce like a lion, then tender like the evening star."}
{"inputs": "Relationships are all about trust and equality. If one person shares, then the other person should share, too."}
{"inputs": "Life is a gift. Don't forget to live it."}
{"inputs": "The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers & cities; but to know someone who thinks & feels with us, & who, though distant, is close to us in spirit, this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden."}
{"inputs": "Albert Camus wrote that the only serious question is whether to kill yourself or not.Tom Robbins wrote that the only serious question is whether time has a beginning and an end.Camus clearly got up on the wrong side of bed, and Robbins must have forgotten to set the alarm.There is only one serious question. And that is: Who knows how to make love stay? Answer me that and I will tell you whether or not to kill yourself."}
{"inputs": "That night when you kissed me, I left a poem in your mouth, and you can hear some of the lines every time you breathe out."}
{"inputs": "Cassia.I know which life is my real one now, no matter what happens. It’s the one with you. For some reason, knowing that even one person knows my story makes things different. Maybe it’s like the poem says. Maybe this is my way of not going gentle.I love you. (Ky Markham)"}
{"inputs": "Love who you love while you have them. That's all you can do. Let them go when you must. If you know how to love, you'll never run out."}
{"inputs": "In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours.In all the world, there is no love for you like mine."}
{"inputs": "Were you always such a stubborn, blind, obtuse girl? Are you calling me stupid? Yes, but in a more poetic way! Well, here’s a poem for you. Get lost! "}
{"inputs": "Know that love is truly timeless."}
{"inputs": "I want someone who is fierce and will love me until death and knows that love is as strong as death, and be on my side forever and ever. I want someone who will destroy and be destroyed by me."}
{"inputs": "The acceptance of oneself is the essence of the whole moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook on life. That I feed the hungry, that I forgive an insult, that I love my enemy in the name of Christ -- all these are undoubtedly great virtues. What I do unto the least of my brethren, that I do unto Christ. But what if I should discover that the least among them all, the poorest of all the beggars, the most impudent of all the offenders, the very enemy himself -- that these are within me, and that I myself stand in need of the alms of my own kindness -- that I myself am the enemy who must be loved -- what then? As a rule, the Christian's attitude is then reversed; there is no longer any question of love or long-suffering; we say to the brother within us Raca, and condemn and rage against ourselves. We hide it from the world; we refuse to admit ever having met this least among the lowly in ourselves."}
{"inputs": "The whole world is divided for me into two parts: one is she, and there is all happiness, hope, light; the other is where she is not, and there is dejection and darkness..."}
{"inputs": "Even when I'm dead, I'll swim through the Earth, like a mermaid of the soil, just to be next to your bones."}
{"inputs": "I thought we were a real love relationship. I did. I was very invested in love, but it was just this long long sex thing that could end at any moment because after all, it's just about getting off. Almost all the time, you tell yourself you're loving somebody when you're just using them. This only looks like love."}
{"inputs": "How could I have ever been ashamed of loving Dante Quintana? "}
{"inputs": "I loved you so much once. I did. More than anything in the whole wide world. Imagine that. What a laugh that is now. Can you believe it? We were so intimate once upon a time I can't believe it now. The memory of being that intimate with somebody. We were so intimate I could puke. I can't imagine ever being that intimate with somebody else. I haven't been."}
{"inputs": "Words can never fully say what we want them to say, for they fumble, stammer, and break the best porcelain. The best one can hope for is to find along the way someone to share the path, content to walk in silence, for the heart communes best when it does not try to speak."}

By taking risks’ she said to Brida. ‘ By risking failure, disappointment, disillusion, but never ceasing in you search for Love. As long as you keep looking, you will triumph in the end."}
{"inputs": "But love, I’ve come to understand, is more than three words mumbled before bedtime. Love is sustained by action, a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day."}
{"inputs": "I have always found that actively lovingsaves one from a morbid preoccupationwith the shortcomings of society."}
{"inputs": "You are the only one who has understood even a whisper of me, and I will tell you that I am the only person who has understood even a whisper of you."}

{"inputs": "We're all golden sunflowers inside."}

{"inputs": "When you miss someone....it’s weird…your body doesn’t function normally..as it should. Because I miss you, and my heart…it’s not steady…my soul it sings numb. Fingers are cold…like you…your soul."}

{"inputs": "I should go, I said thickly. Let me know when you want to start practice again. And thanks for...talking. I started to turn; then I heard him say abruptly, No. I glanced back. What? He held my gaze, and something warm and wonderful and powerful shot between us. No, he repeated. I told her no. I... I shut my mouth before my jaw hit the floor. But...why? That was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. You could have had a baby. And she...she was, you know, into you... The ghost of a smile flickered on his face. Yes, she was. Is. And that's why I had to say no. I couldn't return that...couldn't give her what she wanted. Not when... He took a few steps toward me. Not when my heart is somewhere else."}
{"inputs": "It's not reasonable to love people who are only going to die, she said.Nash thought about that for a moment, stroking Small's neck with great deliberation, as if the fate of the Dells depended on that smooth, careful movement. I have two responses to that, He said at last. First, everyone is going to die. Second, love is stupid. It has nothing to do with reason. You love whomever you love. Against all reason I loved my father. He looked at her keenly. Did you love yours? Yes, she whispered.He stroked Small's nose. I love you, he said, even knowing you'll never have me. And I love my brother, more than I ever realized before you came along. You can't help whom you love, Lady. Nor can you know what it's liable to cause you to do."}
{"inputs": "I… What are you saying, Zsadist? she stammered, even though she'd heard every word.He glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table. Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free.His hand was shaking as he held it out. It's messy. Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOUHer lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared.  Maybe you can't read it, he said in a small voice. I can do it over.  She shook her head. I can read it just fine. It's… beautiful. I don't expect anything back. I mean… I know that you don't… feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew."}
{"inputs": "Those whom we most love are often the most alien to us."}
{"inputs": "Love like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots keeping itself alive."}
{"inputs": "Where you go, I shall go; where you die, I shall die, and there will I be buried."}
{"inputs": "She loved the guy. She did it for him. She would’ve done anything for him. Some people are like that. Some loves are like that. Most loves are like that, from what I can see. Your heart starts to feel like an overcrowded lifeboat. You throw your pride out to keep it afloat, and your self-respect and your independence. After a while you start throwing people out—your friends, everyone you used to know. And it’s still not enough. The lifeboat is still sinking, and you know it’s going to take you down with it. I’ve seen that happen to a lot of people here. I think that’s why I’m sick of love."}
{"inputs": "Love makes us such fools."}
{"inputs": "I think everything that happened in Idris-Valentine, Max, Hodge, even Sebastian-I kept shoving it all down, trying to forget, but it's catching up with me. I... I'll get help. I'll get better. I promise. You promise. I swear on the Angel. He ducked his head down, kissed her cheek. The hell with that. I swear on us."}

{"inputs": "A friend of mine once defined love as finding someone you can talk to late into the night"}
{"inputs": "Falling in love is very real, but I used to shake my head when people talked about soul mates, poor deluded individuals grasping at some supernatural ideal not intended for mortals but sounded pretty in a poetry book. Then, we met, and everything changed, the cynic has become the converted, the sceptic, an ardent zealot."}
{"inputs": "And yet another moral occurs to me now: Make love when you can. It's good for you."}
{"inputs": "Your kids require you most of all to love them for who they are, not to spend your whole time trying to correct them."}
{"inputs": "Most things are forgotten over time. Even the war itself, the life-and-death struggle people went through is now like something from the distant past. We’re so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about everyday, too many new things we have to learn. But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone."}
{"inputs": "It’s strange how dreams get under your skin and give your heart a test for what’s real and what’s imaginary."}

{"inputs": "Would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones? "}
{"inputs": "But is it such a bad thing to live like this for just a little while? Just for a few months of one's life, is it so awful to travel through time with no greater ambition than to find the next lovely meal? Or to learn how to speak a language for no higher purpose than that it pleases your ear to hear it? Or to nap in a garden, in a patch of sunlight, in the middle of the day, right next to your favourite fountain? And then to do it again the next day? "}
{"inputs": "The words ‘I Love You’ kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second."}
{"inputs": "Love is like breathing. You take it in and let it out."}
{"inputs": "It ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love."}
{"inputs": "Hate is... It's too easy. Love. Love takes courage."}
{"inputs": "It's like I'm thirteen again and he's my crush. All I'm aware of in this entire roomful of people is him. Where he is, what he's doing, who he's talking to."}

{"inputs": "Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams."}
{"inputs": "Everybody has a home team: It’s the people you call when you get a flat tire or when something terrible happens. It’s the people who, near or far, know everything that’s wrong with you and love you anyways. These are the ones who tell you their secrets, who get themselves a glass of water without asking when they’re at your house. These are the people who cry when you cry. These are your people, your middle-of-the-night, no-matter-what people."}
{"inputs": "Love.Not the kind you see in the movies or hear about on the radio.The real kind.The kind that gets beaten down and bloody, yet perseveres.The kind that hopes even when hope seems foolish.The kind that can forgives. The kind that believes in healing. The kind that can sit in silence and feel renewed.The real kind of love.It's rare and we have it.."}
{"inputs": "I have known her longer, my smile said. True, you have been inside the circle of her arms, tasted her mouth, felt the warmth of her, and that is something I have never had. But there is a part of her that is only for me. You cannot touch it, no matter how hard you might try. And after she has left you I will still be here, making her laugh. My light shining in her. I will still be here long after she has forgotten your name."}
{"inputs": "When it comes to men, deal with them as they are, not how you’d like them to be."}
{"inputs": "The Universe is very, very big.It also loves a paradox. For example, it has some extremely strict rules.Rule number one: Nothing lasts forever.Not you or your family or your house or your planet or the sun. It is an absolute rule. Therefore when someone says that their love will never die, it means that their love is not real, for everything that is real dies. Rule number two: Everything lasts forever."}
{"inputs": "You can't hurt me the way you think you can. But even if you could? I would rather die with the taste of you on my tongue than live and never touch you again. I'm in love with you, Mara. I love you. No matter what you do."}

{"inputs": "I'm tired of living unable to love anyone. I don't have a single friend - not one. And, worst of all, I can't even love myself. Why is that? Why can't I love myself? It's because I can't love anyone else. A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else. Do you understand what I am saying? A person who is incapable of loving another cannot properly love himself."}
{"inputs": "Some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again. Some truths are so painful that only shame can help you live with them. Some things are so sad that only your soul can do the crying for them."}

{"inputs": "I’m stuck babysitting turtle eggs while a volleyball player slash grease monkey slash aquarium volunteer tries to hit on me. I’m not hitting on you, he protested.No? Believe me, you’d know if I was hitting on you. You wouldn’t be able to stop yourself from succumbing to my charms."}
{"inputs": "When you like someone, you like them in spite of their faults. When you love someone, you love them with their faults."}
{"inputs": "I thought perhaps that when you told me you did not love me that my own feelings would fall away and atrophy, but they have not. They have grown every day. I love you now more desperately, this moment, than I have ever loved you before, and in an hour I will love you more than that"}

{"inputs": "I had jumped off the edge, and then, at the very last moment, something reached out and caught me in midair. That something is what I define as love. It is the one thing that can stop a man from falling, powerful enough to negate the laws of gravity."}

{"inputs": "When someone blushes, doesn't that mean 'yes'? "}
{"inputs": "When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar."}
{"inputs": "It was the nicest thing she could imagine. It made her want to have his babies and give him both of her kidneys."}
{"inputs": "How can something so wrong feel so right? "}
{"inputs": "I don't think you can define love."}
{"inputs": "I thought you were gone forever, I thought you’d walked away from everything, because I failed, because I destroyed the only thing that ever mattered to me. I waited for you to come, but you didn’t."}
{"inputs": "So she thoroughly taught him that one cannot take pleasure without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every glance, every last bit of the body has its secret, which brings happiness to the person who knows how to wake it. She taught him that after a celebration of love the lovers should not part without admiring each other, without being conquered or having conquered, so that neither is bleak or glutted or has the bad feeling of being used or misused."}
{"inputs": "To love someone is like moving into a house, Sonja used to say. At first you fall in love in everything new, you wonder every morning that this is one's own, as if they are afraid that someone will suddenly come tumbling through the door and say that there has been a serious mistake and that it simply was not meant to would live so fine. But as the years go by, the facade worn, the wood cracks here and there, and you start to love this house not so much for all the ways it is perfect in that for all the ways it is not. You become familiar with all its nooks and crannies. How to avoid that the key gets stuck in the lock if it is cold outside. Which floorboards have some give when you step on them, and exactly how to open the doors for them not to creak. That's it, all the little secrets that make it your home. - Fredrik Backman , A Man Called Ove"}
{"inputs": "Your beloved and your friends were once strangers. Somehow at a particular time, they came from the distance toward your life. Their arrival seemed so accidental and contingent. Now your life is unimaginable without them. Similarly, your identity and vision are composed of a certain constellation of ideas and feelings that surfaced from the depths of the distance within you. To lose these now would be to lose yourself."}

{"inputs": "It's hard to love a woman and do anything."}
{"inputs": "If one wanted to depict the whole thing graphically, every episode, with its climax, would require a three-dimensional, or, rather, no model: every experience is unrepeatable. What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space."}
{"inputs": "But the you who you are tonight is the same you I was in love with yesterday, the same you I’ll be in love with tomorrow."}

{"inputs": "Well my music was different in high school; I was singing about love—you know, things I don't care about anymore."}
{"inputs": "If you have the woman you love, what more do you need? Well, besides an alibi for the time of her husband’s murder."}
{"inputs": "When you love someone, they become a part of who you are. They're in everything you do. They're in the air you breathe and the water you drink and the blood in your veins. Their touch stays on your skin and their voice stays in your ears and their thoughts stay in your mind. You know their dreams because their nightmares pierce your heart and their good dreams are your dreams too. And you don't think they're perfect, but you know their flaws, the deep-down truth of them, and the shadows of all their secrets, and they don't frighten you away; in fact you love them more for it, because you don't want perfect. You want them. You want— He broke off then, as if realizing everyone was looking at him again. You want what? said Dru with enormous eyes. Nothing, Julian said. I'm just talking."}
{"inputs": "Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable."}
{"inputs": "You know that when I hate you, it is because I love you to a point of passion that unhinges my soul."}
{"inputs": "The only way love can last a lifetime is if it's unconditional. The truth is this: love is not determined by the one being loved but rather by the one choosing to love."}
{"inputs": "The problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love, and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast."}
{"inputs": "When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again."}

In my language, we call it a HAT. It keeps my ears warm. Oh my God, Sam said again, and closed the distance between us. He cupped my face in his hands and studied me. It’s horribly cute. He kissed me, looked at the hat, and then he kissed me again. I vowed never to lose the pom-pom hat."}
{"inputs": "To be loved but not known is comforting but superficial. To be known and not loved is our greatest fear. But to be fully known and truly loved is, well, a lot like being loved by God. It is what we need more than anything. It liberates us from pretense, humbles us out of our self-righteousness, and fortifies us for any difficulty life can throw at us."}

{"inputs": "Memory is a funny thing. When I was in the scene, I hardly paid it any mind. I never stopped to think of it as something that would make a lasting impression, certainly never imagined that eighteen years later I would recall it in such detail. I didn't give a damn about the scenery that day. I was thinking about myself. I was thinking about the beautiful girl walking next to me. I was thinking about the two of us together, and then about myself again. It was the age, that time of life when every sight, every feeling, every thought came back, like a boomerang, to me. And worse, I was in love. Love with complications. The scenery was the last thing on my mind."}

{"inputs": "Do you remember all of your audiences? Marco asks. Not all of them, Celia says. But I remember the people who look at me the way you do. What way might that be? As though they cannot decide if they are afraid of me or they want to kiss me. I am not afraid of you, Marco says."}
{"inputs": "Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal."}
{"inputs": "Those who really love you don't mean to hurt you and if they do, you can't see it in their eyes but it hurts them too."}
{"inputs": "Lover? I don't know. I don't know if she loves me. I don't know if I love her. All I can say is, she's the one I think about. All the time. She's the voice I want to hear. She's the face I hope to see."}

{"inputs": "Love is honesty. Love is a mutual respect for one another."}
{"inputs": "Someone real, I hear myself saying. Someone who never has to pretend, and who I never have to pretend around. Someone who's smart, but knows how to laugh at himself. Someone who would listen to a symphony and start to cry, because he understands music can be too big for words. Someone who knows me better than I know myself. Someone I want to talk to first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Someone I feel like I've known my whole life, even if I haven't."}
{"inputs": "Isn't it funny.I'm enjoying my hatred so much more than i ever enjoyed love. Love is temperamental. Tiring. It makes demands. Love uses you, changes its mind. But hatred, now, that's something you can use. Sculpt. Wield. It's hard, or soft, however you need it. Love humiliates you, but Hatred cradles you."}

How could he describe how it felt when she finished his sentences, turnec the mug they were sharing so that her mouth landed where his had been? How did he explain the way they could be in a locker room, or underwater, or in the piney woods of Maine, bus as long as Em was with him, he was at home? "}
{"inputs": "For a long time, she held a special place in my heart. I kept this special place just for her, like a Reserved sign on a quiet corner table in a restaurant. Despite the fact that I was sure I'd never see her again."}
{"inputs": "Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."}
{"inputs": "And he knew, also, what the old man was thinking as his tears flowed, and he, Rieux, thought it too: that a loveless world is a dead world, and always there comes an hour when one is weary of prisons, of one's work, and of devotion to duty, and all one craves for is a loved face, the warmth and wonder of a loving heart."}
{"inputs": "Love is—a shade of what I feel."}
{"inputs": "Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill that love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel."}
{"inputs": "If you have it love, you don't need to have anything else, and if you don't have it, it doesn't matter much what else you have."}
{"inputs": "So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you ever meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing.'I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.'There's a silver lining I've been looking for, ' she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was a blissful oblivion, better than firewhiskey; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand on her back, the other in her long sweet-smelling hair..."}

{"inputs": "We are not held back by the love we didn't receive in the past, but by the love we're not extending in the present."}
{"inputs": "There used to be days that I thought I was okay, or at least that I was going to be. We'd be hanging out somewhere and everything would just fit right and I would think 'it will be okay if it can just be like this forever' but of course nothing can ever stay just how it is forever."}
{"inputs": "But what was there to say? Only that there were tears. Only that Quietness and Emptiness fitted together like stacked spoons. Only that there was a snuffling in the hollows at the base of a lovely throat. Only that a hard honey-colored shoulder had a semicircle of teethmarks on it. Only that they held each other close, long after it was over. Only that what they shared that night was not happiness, but hideous grief.Only that once again they broke the Love Laws. That lay down who should be loved. And how. And how much."}
{"inputs": "Shut up…let me tell you, LET ME. Every time I look at your face or even remember it, it wrecks me. And the way you are with me and you’re just fun and you shit all over me and you make fun of me and you’re real. I don’t have enough time in any day to think about you enough...I don’t even think about women anymore. I think about you."}
{"inputs": "Love is made up of three unconditional properties in equal measure:1. Acceptance2. Understanding3. AppreciationRemove any one of the three and the triangle falls apart.Which, by the way, is something highly inadvisable. Think about it — do you really want to live in a world of only two dimensions? So, for the love of a triangle, please keep love whole."}

{"inputs": "One day you fall for this boy. And he touches you with his fingers. And he burns holes in your skin with his mouth. And it hurts when you look at him. And it hurts when you don’t. And it feels like someone’s cut you open with a jagged piece of glass."}
{"inputs": "I think you can love a person too much.You put someone up on a pedestal, and all of a sudden, from that perspective, you notice what's wrong - a hair out of place, a run in a stocking, a broken bone. You spend all your time and energy making it right, and all the while, you are falling apart yourself. You don't even realize what you look like, how far you've deteriorated, because you only have eyes for someone else."}
{"inputs": "I never want to be away from you again, except at work, in the restroom or when one of us is at a movie the other does not want to see."}
{"inputs": "To love is good, too: love being difficult. For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation...Love is a high inducement to the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world for himself for another's sake, it is a great exacting claim upon him, something that chooses him out and calls him to vast things."}
{"inputs": "The whole image is that eternal suffering awaits anyone who questions God's infinite love. That's the message we're brought up with, isn't it? Believe or die! Thank you, forgiving Lord, for all those options."}
{"inputs": "I had fun last night, I told Patch, flicking off my chin strap and handing over my helmet. I'm officially in love with your sheets. That the only thing you're in love with? Nope. Your mattress, too. Some smile crept into Patch's eyes. My bed's an open invitation."}
{"inputs": "You're asking me to define an abstract concept that no one has managed to explain since time began. You sort of sprang it on me, Gansey said. Why do we breathe air? Because we love air? Because we don't want to suffocate. Why do we eat? Because we don't want to starve. How do I know I love her? Because I can sleep after I talk to her. Why? "}
{"inputs": "Brod's life was a slow realization that the world was not for her, and that for whatever reason, she would never be happy and honest at the same time. She felt as if she were brimming, always producing and hoarding more love inside her. But there was no release...So she had to satisfy herself with the idea of love--loving the loving of things whose existence she didn't care at all about. Love itself became the object of her love. She loved herself in love, she loved loving love, as love loves loving, and was able, in that way, to reconcile herself with a world that fell so short of what she would have hoped for. It was not the world that was the great and saving lie, but her willingness to make it beautiful and fair, to live a once-removed life, in a world once-removed from the one in which everyone else seemed to exist."}

{"inputs": "A truth should exist, it should not be usedlike this. If I love youis that a fact or a weapon? "}
{"inputs": "I've always loved strong women, which is lucky for me because once you're over about twenty-five there is no other kind. Women blow my mind. The stuff that routinely gets done to them would make most men curl up and die, but women turn to steel and keep on coming. Any man who claims he's not into strong women is fooling himself mindless; he's into strong women who know how to pout prettily and put on baby voices, and who will end up keeping his balls in her makeup bags."}
{"inputs": "...I told him a story of two people. Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other much when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other."}
{"inputs": "Whatever happened to the dragon? I mustered my primmest tone. He has a name, you know. Adrian pulled back and gave me a curious look. I didn't know, actually. What'd you decide on? Hopper. When Adrian laughed, I added, Best rabbit ever. He'd be proud to know his name is being passed on. Yes, I'm sure he would. Did you name the Mustang too? I think you mean the Ivashkinator. He stared at me in wonder. I told you I loved you, right? Yes, I assured him. Many times."}
{"inputs": "I'm not married, he said softly, because I can't stomach the idea of marrying a woman inferior to me in mind and spirit. It would mean the death of my soul."}
{"inputs": "Remember. The way you make love is the way God will be with you."}
{"inputs": "Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes! "}

{"inputs": "Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly."}

I spat, squeezing him possessively. Three sets of widened eyes fixed on me. That’s when I realized that what I had a firm grip on was no longer his hand."}
{"inputs": "The Heart wants what it wants - or else it does not care"}
{"inputs": "Wisdom is knowing I am nothing, Love is knowing I am everything, and between the two my life moves."}
{"inputs": "Being in love with someone who doesn't even know you exist isn't the worst thing in the world. In fact, it's quite the oppostie. Almost like passing in a term paper that you know sucked, but having that period of time where you haven't gotten your grade back yet -- that kind of exhale where you haven't been rejected, although you pretty much know how it's going to turn out."}
{"inputs": "Love is a possible strength in an actual weakness."}
{"inputs": "I believe in the immeasurable power of love that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance."}
{"inputs": "Hatred would have been easier. With hatred, I would have known what to do. Hatred is clear, metallic, one-handed, unwavering; unlike love."}
{"inputs": "I don't want to know about love.''But you should, my child. You need to know about love. The things people will do for love. All truths come down to love, do they not? One way or another, they do. See, there is a difference between love and need. Sometimes, what you feel is immediate and without rhyme or reason.' She sat up a little straighter. 'Two people see each across a room or their skin brushes. Their souls recognize the person as their own. It doesn’t need time to figure it. The soul always knows... whether it’s right or wrong."}
{"inputs": "He then put both hands on the door on either side of my head and leaned in close, pinning me against it. I trembled like a downy rabbit caught in the clutches of a wolf. The wolf came closer. He bent his head and began nuzzling my cheek. The problem was…I wanted the wolf to devour me."}

But I realize I am. I don't want you to put your arms around me and say it's all right, that you forgive me. I want you to be sure that you do, and my love for you will last as long as I live. I can see no lightness, no humour, no joke to make. I just hope that we will be able to go back to when we had laughter, and the world was coloured, not black and white and grey. I am so sorry for hurting you. I could inflict all kinds of pain on myself, but it would not take back any I gave to you. - David Power"}

{"inputs": "Love me like you'll never see me again."}
{"inputs": "Everyone has something of beauty about them. But loving lets you look, and look, and look again. You notice the back of a hand, the turn of a head, the way of a walk. When you first love, you look blind and you see it all as the glorious, beloved whole, or a beautiful sum of beautiful parts. But when you see the one you love as pieces, as why's, you can love those parts too, and it's a love at once more complicated and more complete."}
{"inputs": "A best friend is the only one that walks into your life when the world has walked out."}

{"inputs": "He was too perfect, despite being one of the most imperfect people I knew."}
{"inputs": "When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain."}
{"inputs": "Who knows? Maybe they’re right. Maybe we are driven crazy by our feelings. Maybe love is a disease, and we would be better off without it. But we have chosen a different road. And in the end that is the point of escaping the cure: We are free to choose.We are even free to choose the wrong thing."}
{"inputs": "There is emotion in the hug, and there is respect and a form of love. Emotion that comes from honesty, respect that comes from challenge, and the form of love that exists between people whose minds have touched, whose hearts have touched, whose souls have touched. Our minds touched. Our hearts touched. Our souls touched.We separate."}
{"inputs": "That’s love: Two lonely persons keep each other safe and touch each other and talk to each other."}

{"inputs": "What should I do about the wild and the tame? The wild heart that wants to be free, and the tame heart that wants to come home. I want to be held. I don't want you to come too close. I want you to scoop me up and bring me home at nights. I don't want to tell you where I am. I want to keep a place among the rocks where no one can find me. I want to be with you."}
{"inputs": "What you are is a fucking tragedy, Simon Snow. You literally couldn't be a bigger mess. He tries to kiss me, but I pull back- And you like that? I love it. He says Why? Because we match."}

{"inputs": "You might be looking for reasons but there are no reasons."}
{"inputs": "The key to a successful relationship isn’t just in the words, it’s in the choice of punctuation. When you’re in love with someone, a well-placed question mark can be the difference between bliss and disaster, and a deeply respected period or a cleverly inserted ellipsis can prevent all kinds of exclamations."}
{"inputs": "The truth was, he now belonged only to my past, and it was time I begin to accept it, as much as it hurt to do so."}
{"inputs": "It has made me better loving you... it has made me wiser, and easier, and brighter. I used to want a great many things before, and to be angry that I did not have them. Theoretically, I was satisfied. I flattered myself that I had limited my wants. But I was subject to irritation; I used to have morbid sterile hateful fits of hunger, of desire. Now I really am satisfied, because I can’t think of anything better. It’s just as when one has been trying to spell out a book in the twilight, and suddenly the lamp comes in. I had been putting out my eyes over the book of life, and finding nothing to reward me for my pains; but now that I can read it properly I see that it’s a delightful story."}
{"inputs": "Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth."}
{"inputs": "When you were in love, you were capable of learning everything and of knowing things you had never dared even to think, because love was the key to understanding all of the mysteries."}
{"inputs": "What if I were smiling and running into your arms? Would you see then what I see now? "}
{"inputs": "I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact."}

{"inputs": "He's around the twist, ' said Azalea. 'Breaking all the windows? He's mad.' to break all the windows in the house and drown yourself in a bucket but don't actually do it, well, that's love."}
{"inputs": "People do the damndest things when they’re in love."}
{"inputs": "Falling in love is like getting hit by a truck and yet not being mortally wounded. just sick to your stomach, high one minute, low the next. Starving hungry but unable to eat. hot, cold, forever horny, full of hope and enthusiasm, with momentary depressions that wipe you out.It is also not being able to remove the smile from your face, loving life with a mad passionate intensity, and feeling ten years younger.Love does not appear with any warning signs. You fall into it as if pushed from a high diving board. No time to think about what's happening. It's inevitable. An event you can't control. A crazy, heart-stopping, roller-coaster ride that just has to take its course."}
{"inputs": "You're a hopeless romantic, said Faber. It would be funny if it were not serious. It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlor families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios, and televisors, but are not. No, no it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type or receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldn't know this, of course you still can't understand what I mean when i say all this. You are intuitively right, that's what counts."}

{"inputs": "True beauty is something that attacks, overpowers, robs, and finally destroys."}

{"inputs": "Never forget that justice is what love looks like in public."}
{"inputs": "And the story of love is a long sad tale ending in graves."}
{"inputs": "My shoulder will never be the same. I expect you to nurse me back to health."}
{"inputs": "And I'll dance with you in Vienna, I'll be wearing a river's disguise.The hyacinth wild on my shouldermy mouth on the dew of your thighs.And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, with the photographs there and the moss.And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty, my cheap violin and my cross."}
{"inputs": "And if you couldn't be loved, the next best thing was to be let alone."}
{"inputs": "It is important not to suppress your feelings altogether when you are depressed. It is equally important to avoid terrible arguments or expressions of outrage. You should steer clear of emotionally damaging behavior. People forgive, but it is best not to stir things up to the point at which forgiveness is required. When you are depressed, you need the love of other people, and yet depression fosters actions that destroy that love. Depressed people often stick pins into their own life rafts. The conscious mind can intervene. One is not helpless."}
{"inputs": "All the most powerful emotions come from chaos -fear, anger, love- especially love. Love is chaos itself. Think about it! Love makes no sense. It shakes you up and spins you around. And then, eventually , it falls apart."}

{"inputs": "Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have , so to speak , pawned a part of their narcissism."}
{"inputs": "Percy pulled Annabeth close and kissed her...long enough for it to get really awkward for Piper, though she said nothing. She thought about the old rule of Aphrodite's cabin: that to be recognized as a daughter of the love goddess, you had to break someone's heart. Piper had long ago decided to change that rule. Percy and Annabeth were a perfect example of why. You should have to make someone`s heart whole; that was a much better test."}

{"inputs": "Calling it a simple schoolgirl crush was like saying a Rolls-Royce was a vehicle with four wheels, something like a hay-wagon.

{"inputs": "You know all that sympathy that you feel for an abused child who suffers without a good mom or dad to love and care for them? Well, they don't stay children forever. No one magically becomes an adult the day they turn eighteen. Some people grow up sooner, many grow up later. Some never really do. But just remember that some people in this world are older versions of those same kids we cry for."}

{"inputs": "Frustration and Love can’t exist in the same place at the same time, so get real and start doing what you would rather be doing in life. Love your life. All of it. Even the heavy shit that happened to you when you were 8. All of it was and IS perfect."}

She stared at him in bewilderment. What on earth did he mean? Trying to make me jealous? Why would you try to do that? She saw immediately that this was the worst thing she could have asked him. Because, he said, so bitterly that it shocked her, I've been in love with you for ten years, so I thought it seemed like the time to find out whether you felt the same about me. Which, I guess you don't."}
{"inputs": "Love those you hate you."}
{"inputs": "And Max, the king of all wild things, was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all."}
{"inputs": "When you give yourself permission to communicate what matters to you in every situation you will have peace despite rejection or disapproval. Putting a voice to your soul helps you to let go of the negative energy of fear and regret."}
{"inputs": "Your absence has not taught me to be alone, it merely has shown that when together we cast a single shadow on the wall."}
{"inputs": "Remember how it was when we kissed? Armfuls and armfuls of light thrown right at us. A rope dropping down from the sky. How can the word love and the word life even fit in the mouth? "}
{"inputs": "No matter what, nobody can take away the dances you've already had."}
{"inputs": "Perfect love is the most beautiful of all frustrations because it is more than one can express."}
{"inputs": "Brigan was saying her name, and he was sending her a feeling. It was courage and strength, and something else too, as if he were standing with her, as if he'd taken her within himself, letting her rest her entire body for a moment on his backbone, her mind in his mind, her heart in the fire of his.The fire of Brigan's heart was astounding. Fire understood, and almost could not believe, that the feeling he was sending her was love."}
{"inputs": "My point is that love is the most powerful motivator in the world. It spurs mortals to greatness. Their noblest, bravest acts are done for love."}
{"inputs": "Thus with my lips have I denounced you, while my heart, bleeding within me, called you tender names.It was love lashed by its own self that spoke. It was pride half slain that fluttered in the dust. It was my hunger for your love that raged from the housetop, while my own love, kneeling in silence, prayed your forgiveness."}
{"inputs": "Cities were always like people, showing their varying personalities to the traveler. Depending on the city and on the traveler, there might begin a mutual love, or dislike, friendship, or enmity. Where one city will rise a certain individual to glory, it will destroy another who is not suited to its personality. Only through travel can we know where we belong or not, where we are loved and where we are rejected."}
{"inputs": "I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis. I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear for the last mill so that you should reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay, a child near death, so that it came to shore where a man sat, wakeful at midnight, to receive you."}
{"inputs": "Who saidI can't wear my ConverseWith my dress, well babyThat's just me! "}
{"inputs": "I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear."}
{"inputs": "How can love be worthy of its name if one selects solely the pretty things and leaves out the hardships? It is easy to enjoy the good and dislike the bad. Anybody can do that. The real challenge is to love the good and the bad together, not because you need to take the rough with the smooth but because you need to go beyond such descriptions and accept love in its entirety."}
{"inputs": "I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect."}
{"inputs": "Why is the measure of love loss? "}
{"inputs": "Do you like me? No answer.Silence bounced, fell off his tongueand sat between usand clogged my throat.It slaughtered my trust.It tore cigarettes out of my mouth.We exchanged blind words, and I did not cry, I did not beg, but blackness filled my ears, blackness lunged in my heart, and something that had been good, a sort of kindly oxygen, turned into a gas oven."}
{"inputs": "The end of a relationship is not always a failure. Sometimes all the love in the world is not enough to save something. In these cases, it is not a matter of fault from either person. Some things cannot be, it's as simple as that."}
{"inputs": "My love is pizza shaped. Won’t you have a slice? It’s circular, so there’s enough to go around."}
{"inputs": "Adam smiled cheerily. Ronan would start wars and burn cities for that true smile, elastic and amiable."}
{"inputs": "Love blurs your vision; but after it recedes, you can see more clearly than ever. It's like the tide going out, revealing whatever's been thrown away and sunk: broken bottles, old gloves, rusting pop cans, nibbled fishbodies, bones. This is the kind of thing you see if you sit in the darkness with open eyes, not knowing the future. The ruin you've made."}
{"inputs": "Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go."}

{"inputs": "Love is so unpredictable. That's what makes it so great."}
{"inputs": "No matter how close we are to another person, few human relationships are as free from strife, disagreement, and frustration as is the relationship you have with a good dog. Few human beings give of themselves to another as a dog gives of itself. I also suspect that we cherish dogs because their unblemished souls make us wish - consciously or unconsciously - that we were as innocent as they are, and make us yearn for a place where innocence is universal and where the meanness, the betrayals, and the cruelties of this world are unknown."}
{"inputs": "In love, one and one are one."}
{"inputs": "This love of which I speak is slow to lose patience - it looks for a way of being constructive.Love is not possessive.Love is not anxious to impress nor does it cherish inflated ideas of its own ideas.Love has good manners and does not pursue selfish advantage.Love is not touchy.Love does not keep account of evil or gloat over the wickedness of other people. On the contrary, it is glad with all good men when truth prevails.Love knows no limits to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. It is, in fact, the one thing that stands when all else has fallen."}

{"inputs": "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. What then kills love? Only this: Neglect. Not to see you when you stand before me. Not to think of you in the little things. Not to make the road wide for you, the table spread for you. To choose you out of habit not desire, to pass the flower seller without a thought. To leave the dishes unwashed, the bed unmade, to ignore you in the mornings, make use of you at night. To crave another while pecking your cheek. To say your name without hearing it, to assume it is mine to call."}
{"inputs": "I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult."}
{"inputs": "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility."}
{"inputs": "I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out."}
{"inputs": "In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another."}

{"inputs": "Loving's pretty easy. It's letting someone love you that's hard."}
{"inputs": "For she had eyes and chose me."}
{"inputs": "I meant it when I said I didn’t believe in love at first sight. It takes time to really, truly fall for someone. Yet I believe in a moment. A moment when you glimpse the truth within someone, and they glimpse the truth within you. In that moment, you don’t belong to yourself any longer, not completely. Part of you belongs to him; part of him belongs to you. After that, you can’t take it back, no matter how much you want to, no matter how hard you try."}
{"inputs": "With me, illusions are bound to be shattered. I am here to shatter all illusions. Yes, it will irritate you, it will annoy you - that's my way of functioning and working. I will sabotage you from your very roots! Unless you are totally destroyed as a mind, there is no hope for you."}

I try to hide the shudder that goes through me at the word execution, my shoulder screaming with pain, and look up at Tobias. It's hard to blink tears back when I see the terror in Tobias's wide, dark eyes. No, says Tobias. His voice trembles, but his look stern as he shakes his head. I would rather die. I'm afraid you don't have much of a choice in that matter, replies Jeanine lightly.Tobias takes my face in this hands roughly and kisses me, the pressure of his lips pushing mine apart. I forget my pain and the terror of approaching death and for a moment, I am grateful that the memory of that kiss will be fresh in my mind as I meet my end."}
{"inputs": "You didn’t think I’d let you go alone, did you? No, but I’m grateful that I had you with me.Grateful is all I’m going to get, isn’t it? What else were you hoping for?

{"inputs": "I write a lot of songs about love and I think that’s because to me love seems like this huge complicated thing. But it seems like every once in a while, two people get it figured out, two people get it right. And so I think the rest of us, we walk around daydreaming about what that might be like. To find that one great love, where all of a sudden everything that seemed to be so complicated, became simple. And everything that used to seem so wrong all of a sudden seemed right because you were with the person who made you feel fearless."}
{"inputs": "Aelin took a step forward. One step, as if in a daze.She loosed a shuddering breath, and a small, whimpering noise came out of her - a sob. And then she was sprinting down the alley, flying as though the winds themselves pushed at her heels.She flung herself on the male, crashing into him hard enough that anyone else might have gone rocking back into the stone wall. But the male grabbed her to him, his massive arms wrapping around her tightly and lifting her up. Nesryn made to approach, but Aedion stopped her with a hand on her arm.Aelin was laughing as she cried, and the male was just holding her, his hooded head buried in her neck. As if he were breathing her in. Who is that? Nesryn asked.Aedion smiled. Rowan."}

{"inputs": "I love you, he thought, looking at Win. I love every part of you, every thought and word... the entire complex, fascinating bundle of all the things you are. I want you with ten different kinds of need at once. I love all the seasons of you, the way you are now, the thought of how much more beautiful you'll be in the decades to come. I love you for being the answer to every question my heart could ask."}
{"inputs": "When forever becomes a place...when forever ceases to be just a word… when it ceases to be just a measurement of time…but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts... that is a reflection of true love."}

{"inputs": "He was afraid of defiling the love which filled his soul."}
{"inputs": "Nothing in life is worth, turning your back on, if you love it."}
{"inputs": "I am not a believer in love at first sight. For love, in its truest form, is not the thingof starry-eyed or star-crossed lovers, it is far more organic, requiring nurturing and timeto fully bloom, and, as such, seen best not in its callow youth but in its wrinkled maturity.Like all living things, love, too, struggles against hardship, and in the process shedsits fatuous skin to expose one composed of more than just a storm of emotion–one of loyaltyand divine friendship. Agape. And though it may be temporarily blinded by adversity, it never gives in or up, holding tight to lofty ideals that transcend this earth andtime–while its counterfeit simply concludes it was mistaken and quickly runs off tofind the next real thing."}
{"inputs": "Eternity is in love with the productions of time."}
{"inputs": "And then I opened my eyes and it was just Grace and me - nothing anywhere but Grace and me - she pressing her lips together as though she were keeping my kiss inside her, and me, holding this moment that was as fragile as a bird in my hands."}

{"inputs": "Love as thou wilt"}
{"inputs": "If only it were possible to love without injury – fidelity isn’t enough: I had been faithful to Anne and yet I had injured her. The hurt is in the act of possession: we are too small in mind and body to possess another person without pride or to be possessed without humiliation. In a way I was glad that my wife had struck out at me again – I had forgotten her pain for too long, and this was the only kind of recompense I could give her. Unfortunately the innocent are always involved in any conflict. Always, everywhere, there is some voice crying from a tower. "}
{"inputs": "His noise is getting quieter, but I can still see it there still-See how he feels the skin of my hand against his, see how he wants to take it and press it against his mouth, how he wants to breathe in the smell of me and how beautiful I look to him, how strong after all that illness, and how he wants to just lightly touch my neck, just there, and how he wants to take me in his arms and- Oh, God, he says, looking away suddenly. Viola, I'm sorry, I didn't mean- But I just put my hand to the back of his neck-And he says, Viola-? And I pull myself towards him-And I kiss him.And it feels like, finally."}
{"inputs": "I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now so he shall never know how I love him and that not because he's handsome Nelly but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire."}

{"inputs": "I haven't had that one great love, which is good. I don't want that to be in the past, I want it to be in the future."}
{"inputs": "Love...no such thing.Whatever it is that binds families and married couples together, that's not love. That's stupidity or selfishness or fear. Love doesn't exist. Self interest exists, attachment based on personal gain exists, complacency exists. But not love. Love has to be reinvented, that’s certain."}
{"inputs": "I've been saying it so long to you, you just wouldn't listen. Every time you said 'Farm Boy do this' you thought I was answering 'As you wish' but that's only because you were hearing wrong. 'I love you' was what it was, but you never heard."}
{"inputs": "These pictures are my heart. And if my heart was a canvas, every square inch of it would be painted over with you."}

{"inputs": "I love you with everything I am, everything I've been, and everything I hope to be. I love you with my past, and I love you for my future. I love you for the children we'll have and for the years we'll have together. I love you for every one of my smiles and even more, for every one of your smiles."}
{"inputs": "There are so many men, all endlessly attempting to sweep me off my feet. And there is one of you, trying just the opposite. Making sure my feet are firm beneath me, lest I fall."}
{"inputs": "And maybe that was love. Being so vulnerable and allowing someone else in so far they could hurt you, but they also give you everything."}
{"inputs": "You can never be wise and be in love at the same time."}
{"inputs": "I close my eyes, thinking that there is nothing like an embrace after an absence, nothing like fitting my face into the curve of his shoulder and filling my lungs with the scent of him."}
{"inputs": "There is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person, however dear and beloved, but an expansion, an interpretation, of one's self, the very meaning of one's soul."}
{"inputs": "It's not enough to believe! Don't you see that, you stupid girl? You could spend your whole life hoping and believing! If a love affair is one-sided, then it's only ever a question, never an answer. You can't live your life waiting for an answer."}

If you were a lord, you should be my lord, And the same if you were a thief, said she. And if you are a harper, you shall be my harper, For it makes no matter to me, to me, For it makes no matter to me. But what if it prove that I am no harper? That I lied for your love most monstrously? Why, then I'll teach you to play and sing, For I dearly love a good harp, said she."}
{"inputs": "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius."}
{"inputs": "Depression is the flaw in love. To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair."}
{"inputs": "Love: the sickest of Irony’s sick jokes. The place where logic and order go to die."}
{"inputs": "A: The soul wanders in the dark, until it finds love. And so, wherever our love goes, there we find our soul.Q: It always happens? A: If we're lucky. And if we let ourselves be blind. Q: Instead of watching out? A: Instead of always watching out."}
{"inputs": "That was the only time, as I stood there, looking at that strange rubbish, feeling the wind coming across those empty fields, that I started to imagine just a little fantasy thing, because this was Norfolk after all, and it was only a couple of weeks since I’d lost him. I was thinking about the rubbish, the flapping plastic in the branches, the shore-line of odd stuff caught along the fencing, and I half-closed my eyes and imagined this was the spot where everything I'd ever lost since my childhood had washed up, and I was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure would appear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I'd see it was Tommy, and he'd wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyond that --I didn't let it-- and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn't sobbing or out of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be."}
{"inputs": "You have made a place in my heart where I thought there was no room for anything else. You have made flowers grow where I cultivated dust and stones. Remember this, on this journey you insist on making. If you die, I will not survive you long."}
{"inputs": "Jealous? Maybe. No reason. I like my ladies with a pulse."}
{"inputs": "But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have ot believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is FEARLESS."}
{"inputs": "I’m a fake fact factory. The things I make are the things I make up. Also, as a side business, I make love. Actually, I just made that up."}
{"inputs": "Love simply is."}
{"inputs": "Truth without love is brutality, and love without truth is hypocrisy."}
{"inputs": "...the opposite of love is not hate -- it's apathy. It's not giving a damn. If somebody hates me, they must feel something ... or they couldn't possibly hate. Therefore, there's some way in which I can get to them."}
{"inputs": "Can't you just like a girl who likes you back? ''None of them likes me back. I may as well like the one I really want."}

{"inputs": "I never lie, I said offhand. At least not to those I don't love."}
{"inputs": "Love, like everything else in life, should be a discovery, an adventure, and like most adventures, you don’t know you’re having one until you’re right in the middle of it."}

{"inputs": "Well, it's simple to love someone, she said. But it's hard to know when you need to say it out loud."}
{"inputs": "Love is not a consequence. Love is not a choice. Love is a thirst. A need as vital to the soul as water is to the body. Love is a precious draught that not only soothes a parched throat, but it vitalizes a man. It fortifies him enough that he is willing to slay dragons for the woman who offers it. Take that draught of love from me and I will shrivel to dust. To take it from a man dying of thirst and give it to another whilst he watches is a cruelty I never thought you capable of."}
{"inputs": "You deserve all that and more. It made me happy to see you suffer. I would do it all over again if I could.' I realized I was shaking as the words tumbled out of me. 'I would do it again and again. Every night I would torment you and laugh. Do you understand? You are never safe with me.' I drew a shuddering breath, trying to will away the sting of tears.He opened his eyes and stared up at me as if I were the door out of Arcadia and back to the true sky. 'That's what makes you my favorite.' He reached up and wiped a tear off my cheek with his thumb. 'Every wicked bit of you."}
{"inputs": "I want to try with someone who loves me enough to try with me. I want to grow old looking at the same face every morning. I want to grow old looking at the same face every night at the dinner table. I want to be one of those old couples you see still holding hands and laughing after fifty years of marriage. That's what I want. I want to be someone's forever."}
{"inputs": "I make love with a focus and intensity that most people reserve for sleep."}
{"inputs": "I love being in love, but I also love other things, like not being jealous, overly sensitive, or needy."}
{"inputs": "Our love was a two-person game. At least until one of us died, and the other became a murderer."}
{"inputs": "It didn't make you noble to step away from something that wasn't working, even if you thought you were the reason for the malfunction. Especially then. It just made you a quitter. Because if you were the problem, chances were you could also be the solution. The only way to find out was to take another shot."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes I get real lonely sleeping with you."}
{"inputs": "Love is the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth... Love is as love does. Love is an act of will -- namely, both an intention and an action. Will also implies choice. We do not have to love. We choose to love."}

{"inputs": "I say, In the contract we said we wouldn’t break each other’s hearts. What if we do it again? Fiercely he says, What if we do? If we’re so guarded, it’s not going to be anything. Let’s do it fucking for real, Lara Jean. Let’s go all in. No more contract. No more safety net. You can break my heart. Do whatever you want with it."}
{"inputs": "I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize. The one who gives you four arms, four legs, four eyes, and has the other half of your heart. There's only one of those, so what are all the other things for? Like dating? "}
{"inputs": "Sometimes the one who is running from the Life/Death/Life nature insists on thinking of love as a boon only. Yet love in its fullest form is a series of deaths and rebirths. We let go of one phase, one aspect of love, and enter another. Passion dies and is brought back. Pain is chased away and surfaces another time. To love means to embrace and at the same time to withstand many endings, and many many beginnings- all in the same relationship."}
{"inputs": "Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path."}
{"inputs": "Nothing had changed. I was the stupid one again. I was the girl who never understood who she was to people."}
{"inputs": "One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, and compassion"}
{"inputs": "Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours."}
{"inputs": "I’ve become skeptical of the unwritten rule that just because a boy and girl appear in the same feature, a romance must ensue. Rather, I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire each other to live - if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love."}
{"inputs": "He’s dozed off again, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if he’d be happy to lie there gazing at me forever."}
{"inputs": "We shouldn't teach great books we should teach a love of reading. Knowing the contents of a few works of literature is a trivial achievement. Being inclined to go on reading is a great achievement. "}
{"inputs": "I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love."}
{"inputs": "He must love you very much, ' Gavril said once I had my footing.I couldn't look at him. 'What makes you say that? ' Gavril sighed. 'I've known Maxon since he was a child. He's never stood up to his father like that."}
{"inputs": "Love may forgive all infirmities and love still in spite of them: but Love cannot cease to will their removal."}
{"inputs": "Love is a drama of contradictions."}
{"inputs": "Often men who have been emotionally neglected and abused as children by dominating mothers bond with assertive women, only to have their childhood feelings of being engulfed surface. While they could not 'smash their mommy' and still receive love, they find that they can engage in intimate violence with partners who respond to their acting out by trying harder to connect with them emotionally, hoping that the love offered in the present will heal the wounds of the past. If only one party in the relationship is working to create love, to create the space of emotional connection, the dominator model remains in place and the relationship just becomes a site for continuous power struggle."}
{"inputs": "The problem, of course, was that he saw the world in black and white. And he got to decide what was black and what was white. You can't love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little."}
{"inputs": "Then she did something so unexpected Nico would later think he dreamed it. She walked up to Nico, who was standing to one side in the shadows, as usual. She grabbed his hand and pulled him gently into the firelight. ‘We had one home, ’ she said. ‘Now we have two.’ She gave Nico a big hug and the crowd roared with approval. For once, Nico didn’t feel like pulling away. He buried his face in Reyna’s shoulder and blinked the tears out of his eyes."}
{"inputs": "Friendship often ends in love. But love in friendship never. "}
{"inputs": "I told him I was going to betray you, and betray Lyra, and he believed me because I was corrupt and full of wickedness; he looked so deep I felt sure he'd see the truth. But I lied too well. I was lying with every nerve and fiber and everything I'd ever done...I wanted him to find no good in me, and he didn't. There is none."}
{"inputs": "When I first met you, that's what I remember. I looked up at the sky and thought, I'm going to love this person because even the sky looks different."}
{"inputs": "I am surprised how difficult for people is to say I love you . They only say the three magic words when they are sure they will hear I love you too back. C'mon! Spread the energy of love without expecting anything! Cowards are incapable of expressing love; it is the prerogative of the brave"}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all romance is like that not a contract between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life. Only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour. "}
{"inputs": "It often occurs that pride and selfishness are muddled with strength and independence. They are neither equal nor similar; in fact, they are polar opposites. A coward may be so cowardly that he masks his weakness with some false personification of power. He is afraid to love and to be loved because love tends to strip bare all emotional barricades. Without love, strength and independence are prone to losing every bit of their worth; they become nothing more than a fearful, intimidated, empty tent lost somewhere in the desert of self."}
{"inputs": "Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning."}
{"inputs": "She’s kept her love for him as alive as the summer they first met. In order to do this, she’s turned life away. Sometimes she subsists for days on water and air. Being the only known complex life-form to do this, she should have a species named after her. Once Uncle Julian told me how the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti said that sometimes just to paint a head you have to give up the whole figure. To paint a leaf, you have to sacrifice the whole landscape. It might seem like you’re limiting yourself at first, but after a while you realize that having a quarter-of-an-inch of something you have a better chance of holding on to a certain feeling of the universe than if you pretended to be doing the whole sky.My mother did not choose a leaf or a head. She chose my father. And to hold on to a certain feeling, she sacrificed the world."}
{"inputs": "You dumb-ass, I crooned, kissing her on the forehead. You don't share me. You own me."}
{"inputs": "Every friendship travels at sometime through the black valley of despair. This tests every aspect of your affection. You lose the attraction and the magic. Your sense of each other darkens and your presence is sore. If you can come through this time, it can purify with your love, and falsity and need will fall away. It will bring you onto new ground where affection can grow again."}
{"inputs": "You’re in my every breath and every thought, intertwined so deep inside me that love’s not a strong enough word—you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command. A hundred years? It’ll never be enough. I want eternity."}
{"inputs": "The thing with your heart's desire is that your heart doesn't even know what it desires until it turns up."}
{"inputs": "and when love came to us twice and lied to us twice we decided to never love again that was fair fair to us and fair to love itself. we ask for no mercy or no miracles; we are strong enough to live and to die and to kill flies, attend the boxing matches, go to the racetrack, live on luck and skill, get alone, get alone often, and if you can't sleep alone be careful of the words you speak in your sleep; and ask for no mercy no miracles; and don't forget: time is meant to be wasted, love failsand death is useless."}
{"inputs": "Her heart had grown so familiar to the pain of life without him, that to respond now seemed too large a pleasure she could not endure. If pain was love, then she loved fiercely. Yet knew she could not be near that boy again."}
{"inputs": "She held up her calloused, grimy fingers. Leo couldn't help thinking there was nothing hotter than a girl who didn't mind getting her hands dirty. But of course, that was just a general comment. Didn't apply to Calypso. Obviously."}
{"inputs": "Age has no reality except in the physical world. The essence of a human being is resistant to the passage of time. Our inner lives are eternal, which is to say that our spirits remain as youthful and vigorous as when we were in full bloom. Think of love as a state of grace, not the means to anything, but the alpha and omega. An end in itself."}
{"inputs": "Real friendship or love is not manufactured or achieved by an act of will or intention. Friendship is always an act of recognition."}
{"inputs": "When you need to be loved, you take love wherever you can find it. When you are desperate to be loved, feel love, know love, you seek out what you think love should look like. When you find love, or what you think love is, you will lie, kill, and steal to keep it. But learning about real love comes from within. It cannot be given. It cannot be taken away. It grows from your ability to re-create within yourself, the essence of loving experiences you have had in your life."}
{"inputs": "Americans... are forever searching for love in forms it never takes, in places it can never be. It must have something to do with the vanished frontier."}
{"inputs": "He smiles at me, and I am suddenly seventeen again - the year I realize that love doesn't follow the rules, the year I understood that nothing is worth having so much as something unattainable"}
{"inputs": "Not enough, he said, letting her hair slip through his fingers. If I kiss you all day, everyday, for the rest of my life, it won't be enough."}
{"inputs": "The worst thing you can do if you miss or need someone is let them know it."}
{"inputs": "There are many forms of love and affection, some people can spend their whole lives together without knowing each other's names. Naming is a difficult and time-consuming process; it concerns essences, and it means power. But on the wild nights who can call you home? Only the one who knows your name."}
{"inputs": "They say: 'If a man knew himself, he would know all mankind.'I say: 'If a man loved mankind, he would know something of himself."}
{"inputs": "So what I want to know is why it is that I can no longer find you, in my mind. You are still there, just, but you are there like a ghost, a will o' the wisp. Not long ago you burned--your heart burned--in my mind like silver fire. But after that night in the inn it became patchy and dim, and now it is not there at all. Could it be that the heart that you seek is no longer my own? I have given my heart to another. The boy? The one in the inn? With the unicorn? Yes. You should have let me take it back then, for my sisters and me. We could have been young again, well into the next age of the world. Your boy will break it, or waste it, or lose it. They all do. Nonetheless, he has my heart. I hope your sisters will not be too hard on you, when you return to them without it."}
{"inputs": "Touchstone watched, suddenly conscious that he probably only had five seconds left to be alone with Sabriel, to say something, to say anything. Perhaps the last five seconds they ever would have alone together.I am not afraid, he said to himself. I love you, he whispered. I hope you don't mind."}
{"inputs": "There are some experiences in life they haven't invented the right words for."}
{"inputs": "I think Heaven will be like a first kiss."}
{"inputs": "Her desires are mine. Her wishes are mine. Should even the world stand against her, my blade will be at her side. And should it fail to protect her, let my own existence be forfeit. - Ash"}
{"inputs": "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."}
{"inputs": "You know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! "}
{"inputs": "Love comes with a knife, not some shy question, and not with fears for its reputation! "}
{"inputs": "Love is not primarily a relationship to a specific person; it is an attitude, an ordination of character which determines the relatedness of the person to the whole world as a whole, not toward one object of love"}
{"inputs": "I know we're not saints or virgins or lunatics; we know all the lust and lavatory jokes, and most of the dirty people; we can catch buses and count our change and cross the roads and talk real sentences. But our innocence goes awfully deep, and our discreditable secret is that we don't know anything at all, and our horrid inner secret is that we don't care that we don't."}
{"inputs": "In this whole screwed-up town, you're the only thing that's always been right to me, he whispered. I love you, Claire. She saw something that might have been just a flash of panic go across his expression, but then he steadied again. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do. I love you."}
{"inputs": "The moment our lips met, I knew with pure and piercing certainty that I would have waited for him forever."}
{"inputs": "Dexter, I love you so much. So, so much, and I probably always will. I just don't like you anymore. I'm sorry."}
{"inputs": "You can’t leave yet. I’m not finished falling in love with you."}
{"inputs": "One rarely falls in love without being as much attracted to what is interestingly wrong with someone as what is objectively healthy."}
{"inputs": "If we’re going to kiss, it has to be book-worthy."}
{"inputs": "You don’t love because: you love despite; not for the virtues, but despite the faults."}
{"inputs": "There has to be a moment at the beginning where you wonder whether you’re in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself. If the moment doesn’t pass, that’s it—you’re done. And if the moment does pass, it never goes that far. It stands in the distance, ready for whenever you want it back. Sometimes it’s even there when you thought you were searching for something else, like an escape route, or your lovers’ face."}
{"inputs": "Deciding whether or not to trust a person is like deciding whether or not to climb a tree because you might get a wonderful view from the highest branch or you might simply get covered in sap and for this reason many people choose to spend their time alone and indoors where it is harder to get a splinter."}
{"inputs": "One word more. You look as if you thought it tainted you to beloved by me. You cannot avoid it. Nay, I, if I would, cannotcleanse you from it. But I would not, if I could. I have neverloved any woman before: my life has been too busy, my thoughtstoo much absorbed with other things. Now I love, and will love.But do not be afraid of too much expression on my part."}
{"inputs": "It takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory, and still to love it. And even more courage to see it in the one you love"}
{"inputs": "I regret... Tobias tilts his head, and sighs. I regret my choice. What Choice? , and... I felt like maybe I could make something more of my decision. "}
{"inputs": "For which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? "}
{"inputs": "You've got to have someone who loves your body. Who doesn't define you, but sees you. Who loves what he sees. Who you don't have to struggle to be good enough for."}
{"inputs": "I let myself slip away... Just to stay sane. Just to get through it. And when I felt myself slipping too far, I held on to the one thing I'm always sure of - Blue eyes. Bronze curls. The fact that Simon Snow is the most powerful magician alive. That nothing can hurt him, not even me. That Simon Snow is alive. And I'm hopelessly in love with him."}
{"inputs": "Millions of people are suffering: they want to be loved but they don't know how to love. And love cannot exist as a monologue; it is a dialogue, a very harmonious dialogue. "}
{"inputs": "Follow me, reader! Who told you that there is no true, faithful, eternal love in this world! May the liar's vile tongue be cut out! Follow me, my reader, and me alone, and I will show you such a love! "}
{"inputs": "Before I go, he said, and paused -- I may kiss her? It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, A life you love."}
{"inputs": "Friendship is selfless love, care, respect, and honor not a profitable opportunity."}
{"inputs": "Think how you love me, she whispered. I don’t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember. Somewhere inside me there’ll always be the person I am to-night."}
{"inputs": "We wanted the freedom to love. We wanted the freedom to choose. Now we have to fight for it."}
{"inputs": "Love lasts about seven years. That's how long it takes for the cells of the body to totally replace themselves."}
{"inputs": "She put one hand on mine. When someone is in your heart, they’re never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times."}
{"inputs": "You had to be willing to fight in order for a love story to last a life time."}
{"inputs": "I knew, you would do me good, in some way, at some time;- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not- (again he stopped)- did not (he proceeded hastily) strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. "}
{"inputs": "Stains are even worse when you're the only one who can see them."}
{"inputs": "If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden."}
{"inputs": "I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest - blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully as he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but more animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character - perfect concord is the result."}
{"inputs": "People who love themselves, don’t hurt other people. The more we hate ourselves, the more we want others to suffer."}
{"inputs": "Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own."}
{"inputs": "Love is a trap. When it appears, we see only its light, not its shadows."}
{"inputs": "Love! Love until the night collapses! "}
{"inputs": "If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with."}
{"inputs": "Look at me, chica. When she does, I repeat, Eres hermosa. What does it mean? You're beautiful."}
{"inputs": "It’s hard to communicate anything exactly and that’s why perfect relationships between people are difficult to find."}
{"inputs": "I didn't know love could leave the lights on all the time."}
{"inputs": "twice I have lived forever in a smile"}
{"inputs": "alone with everybody the flesh covers the bone and they put a mind in there and sometimes a soul, and the women break vases against the walls and them men drink too much and nobody finds the one but they keep looking crawling in and out of beds.flesh covers the bone and the flesh searches for more than flesh.there's no chance at all:we are all trapped by a singular fate.nobody ever finds the one.the city dumps fill the junkyards fill the mad houses fill the hospitals fill the graveyards fill nothing else fills."}
{"inputs": "Your truest friends are the ones who will stand by you in your darkest moments--because they're willing to brave the shadows with you--and in your greatest moments--because they're not afraid to let you shine."}
{"inputs": "Everyone's a little crazy. Some people just hide it better than others."}
{"inputs": "You, of all people, deserve a happy ending. Despite everything that happened to you, you aren't bitter. You aren't cold. You've just retreated a little and been shy, and that's okay. If I were a fairy godmother, I would give you your heart's desire in an istant. And I would wipe away your tears and tell you not to cry.-Rachel to Julia"}
{"inputs": "Love, whether newly born or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always create sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the outward world."}
{"inputs": "He looks at her and smiles. You're sort of dangerous, you know? She stares at him. Me? Yeah, he says sitting back. I'm way too honest with you."}
{"inputs": "When I asked my da how ye knew which was the right woman, he told me when the time came, I'd have no doubt. And I didn't. When I woke in the dark under that tree on the road to Leoch, with you sitting on my chest, cursing me for bleeding to death, I said to myself 'Jamie Fraser, for all ye canna see what she looks like, and for all she weights as much as a good draft horse, this is the woman."}
{"inputs": "May you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live."}
{"inputs": "I...I sang, she whispered, if that matters, and Karou felt her heart pulled to pieces. This Misbegotten warrior, fiercest of them all, had crouched in an icy stream bed to sing a chimera soul into her canteen, because she hadn't known what else to do.The singing wouldn't have mattered, but she wasn't going to tell Liraz that. If Ziri's soul was in that canteen, Karou would happily learn whatever song Liraz had sung and make it part of her resurrection ritual forever, just so that the angel would never feel that she'd been foolish."}
{"inputs": "So for now, I will miss you like I’ll never see you again, And the next time I see you, I will kiss you like I’ll never kiss you again, And when I fall asleep beside you I will fall asleep as if I’ll never wake up again, because I don’t know if I will.I don’t know if I will.- I Will Love You Like The World Is Ending"}
{"inputs": "That kind of love should've been able to beat sickness. That kind of love should've conquered anything."}
{"inputs": "If I never see you again I will always carry youinsideoutsideon my fingertipsand at brain edgesand in centerscentersof what I am ofwhat remains."}
{"inputs": "You know I'm old in some ways-in others-well, I'm just a little girl. I like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulness-and I dread responsibility."}
{"inputs": "When you leave, weary of me, without a word I shall gently let you go."}
{"inputs": "Love is eternal -- the aspect may change, but not the essence. There is the same difference in a person before and after he is in love as there is in an unlighted lamp and one that is burning. The lamp was there and was a good lamp, but now it is shedding light too, and that is its real function. And love makes one calmer about many things, and that way, one is more fit for one's work."}
{"inputs": "It's easy to look back and see it, and it's easy to give the advice. But the sad fact is, most people don't look beneath the surface until it's too late."}
{"inputs": "How could I have been so ignorant? she thinks. So stupid, so unseeing, so given over to carelessness. But without such ignorance, such carelessness, how could we live? If you knew what was going to happen, if you knew everything that was going to happen next—if you knew in advance the consequences of your own actions—you'd be doomed. You'd be as ruined as God. You'd be a stone. You'd never eat or drink or laugh or get out of bed in the morning. You'd never love anyone, ever again. You'd never dare to."}
{"inputs": "It's usually the selfish people who are loved the most. They do what you deny yourself, and you love them for it. You give them your heart."}
{"inputs": "How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true; But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face."}
{"inputs": "No matter how bad your heart is broken, the world doesn't stop for your grief."}
{"inputs": "I am as wrapped up in her as a vine that clings to a tree seeking for sustenance. She’s tied me to her for eternity. She’s my home. She’s my reason for being. To win and hold her heart is my only purpose."}
{"inputs": "She asked if I loved another woman, so I answered honestly and said, Dinner was great, but I could go for dessert."}
{"inputs": "I can do pain. That’s the easy part of life. It’s everything else, happiness, laughter, love, that’s fucking complicated."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company."}
{"inputs": "some people fall in love over and over again while some people can only do it once."}
{"inputs": "Child, it's a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that can happen to her, because after she's faced the worst she can't ever really fear anything again. ...Scarlett, always save something to fear— even as you save something to love..."}
{"inputs": "Knees suddenly weak, she reached for his forearms to stabilize herself. You came for me.He beamed, looking for all the world like a selfless, daring hero.Don’t sound so surprised. Dropping the cane, he pulled her into a crushing embrace that tore her away from Wolf and lifted her clean off the floor. It turns out you are worth a lot of money on the black market."}
{"inputs": "That's the nature of being a parent, Sabine has discovered. You'll love your children far more than you ever loved your parents, and -- in the recognition that your own children cannot fathom the depth of your love -- you come to understand the tragic, unrequited love of your own parents."}
{"inputs": "He promised us that everything would be okay. I was a child, but I knew that everything would not be okay. That did not make my father a liar. It made him my father."}
{"inputs": "All I want from you is to trust me with what little you can, and grow in loving people around you with the same love I share with you. It's not your job to change them, or to convince them. You are free to love without an agenda."}
{"inputs": "Well, you can think what you want, so long as you remember - no matter how ordinary things seem between us - I'm still here, still in love with you, and care about you more than any other guy, evil or otherwise, ever will."}
{"inputs": "The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it's not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of another person--without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other. They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now. Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other."}
{"inputs": "When she came to her senses again she cut off all contact with him. It had not been easy, but she had steeled herself. The last time she saw him she was standing on a platform in the tunnelbana at Gamla Stan and he was sitting in the train on his way downtown. She had stared at him for a whole minute and decided that she did not have a grain of feeling left, because it would have been the same as bleeding to death. Fuck you."}
{"inputs": "I love you more. I love you enough to let you go and live your dream. I tilted my head and shrugged. Don't you see....? I love you more. He smiled softly and I brushed some hair off his forehead. Running the backs of my fingers down his cheek, I whispered, And, yes, I will miss you, more than you could possibly imagine, but I know that you have to do this Kellan. And you know it too. Stubbornly he shook his head. No, I know that I have to be with you. Everything else is just .... details."}
{"inputs": "I'm beginning to think that maybe it's not just how much you love someone. Maybe what matters is who you are when you're with them."}
{"inputs": "No one compares to you, but there's no you, except in my dreams tonight."}
{"inputs": "Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings."}
{"inputs": "When you're in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks."}
{"inputs": "To fall in love is easy, even to remain in it is not difficult; our human loneliness is cause enough. But it is a hard quest worth making to find a comrade through whose steady presence one becomes steadily the person one desires to be."}
{"inputs": "You don't know when you're twenty-three.You don't know what it really means to crawl into someone else's life and stay there. You can't see all the ways you're going to get tangled, how you're going to bond skin to skin. How the idea of separating will feel in five years, in ten - in fifteen. When Georgie thought about divorce now, she imagined lying side by side with Neal on two operating tables while a team of doctors tried to unthread their vascular systems.She didn't know at twenty-three."}
{"inputs": "Everything I know, I know because of love."}
{"inputs": "If you press me to say why I loved him, I can say no more than because he was he, and I was I."}
{"inputs": "It's good to let God pick a man for you. We don't do so well when we pick them ourselves. They end up lipsticks in a drawer, all those wrong colors you thought looked so good in the package."}
{"inputs": "No matter how long or how difficult, we will undo whatever that Moroi boy has done to you. to me."}
{"inputs": "Whoever said that love hurts was wrong. Love is excruciating, especially when you can feel it slipping through your fingers and there is nothing you can do about it. Like someone was playing tug-of-war with my limbs, ripping to shreds whatever was left behind. What it would feel like when love was lost...I wouldn't survive that"}
{"inputs": "The question, love, is whether you want me enough to take the risk."}
{"inputs": "I'm yours for ever--for ever and ever. Here I stand; I'm as firm as a rock. If you'll only trust me, how little you'll be disappointed. Be mine as I am yours."}
{"inputs": "In the absence of love, we began slowly but surely to fall apart."}
{"inputs": "Every now and then, I’d meet a guy and think that we were getting along great, and suddenly I’d stop hearing from him. Not only did he stop calling, but if I happened to bump into him sometime later he always acted like I had the plague. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t. And it bothered me. It hurt me. With time, it got harder and harder to keep blaming the guys, and I eventually came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me. That maybe I was simply meant to live my life alone."}
{"inputs": "But you cant shut everyone out. I mean you have to have someone to love. . .someone to hold on to. . . someone--"}
{"inputs": "My love is meatloaf flavored. I just wish my meatloaf was also meatloaf flavored."}
{"inputs": "If I could bronze my love, it’d be worthy of a silver medal."}
{"inputs": "Do not allow me to forget you"}
{"inputs": "It's so much easier to convince yourself you're madly in love with someone when you know nothing about him."}

They say you have to earn the right to be loved; no, love is unconditional, if you love someone, they don't have to earn it. But. The right to tell someone that you love them? That has to be earned. You have to earn the right to be believed."}

{"inputs": "What is it about the moment you fall in love? How can such a small measure of time contain such enormity? I suddenly realize why people believe in déjà vu, why people believe they've lived past lives, because there is no way the years I've spent on this earth could possibly encapsulate what I'm feeling. The moment you fall in love feels like it has centuries behind it, generations—all of them rearranging themselves so that this precise, remarkable intersection could happen. In you heart, in your bones, no matter how silly you know it is, you feel that everything has been leading to this, all the secret arrows were pointing here, the universe and time itself crafted this long ago, and you are just now realizing it, you are now just arriving at the place you were always meant to be."}
{"inputs": "Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred."}
{"inputs": "Perfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency. I do not demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you. If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling."}
{"inputs": "If I were rain, That joins sky and earth that otherwise never touch, Could I join two hearts as well? "}
{"inputs": "Wait. This was the first lesson I had learned about love. The day drags along, you make thousands of plans, you imagine every possible conversation, you promise to change your behavior in certain ways -- and you feel more and more anxious until your loved one arrives. But by then, you don't know what to say. The hours of waiting have been transformed into tension, the tension has become fear, and the fear makes you embarrassed about showing affection."}

{"inputs": "For millions of years flowers have been producing thorns. For millions of years sheep have been eating them all the same. And it's not serious, trying to understand why flowers go to such trouble to produce thorns that are good for nothing? It's not important, the war between the sheep and the flowers? It's no more serious and more important than the numbers that fat red gentleman is adding up? Suppose I happen to know a unique flower, one that exists nowhere in the world except on my planet, one that a little sheep can wipe out in a single bite one morning, just like that, without even realizing what he'd doing - that isn't important? If someone loves a flower of which just one example exists among all the millions and millions of stars, that's enough to make him happy when he looks at the stars. He tells himself 'My flower's up there somewhere...' But if the sheep eats the flower, then for him it's as if, suddenly, all the stars went out. And that isn't important? "}
{"inputs": "Nobody in my life has ever known me the way you do. Nobody in my life has ever made me feel as good as you do.

I don't have a daughter, but maybe the love of a daughter is the best, too. I am first and foremost me, but right after that, I am a mother. The best thing that I can ever be, is me. But the best gift that I will ever have, is being a mother."}

{"inputs": "You have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect.

You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid"}
{"inputs": "The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I love her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me, than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection ."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes it’s like people are a million times more beautiful to you in your mind. It’s like you see them through a special lens — but maybe if it’s how you see them, that’s how they really are. It’s like the whole tree falling in the forest thing."}

{"inputs": "What is home? My favorite definition is a safe place, a place where one is free from attack, a place where one experiences secure relationships and affirmation. It's a place where people share and understand each other. Its relationships are nurturing. The people in it do not need to be perfect; instead, they need to be honest, loving, supportive, recognizing a common humanity that makes all of us vulnerable."}

{"inputs": "A first child is your own best foot forward, and how you do cheer those little feet as they strike out. You examine every turn of flesh for precocity, and crow it to the world. But the last one: the baby who trails her scent like a flag of surrender through your life when there will be no more coming after--oh, that' s love by a different name."}
{"inputs": "Growth in love comes from a place of absence, where the imagination is left to it’s own devices and creates you to be much more then reality would ever allow."}
{"inputs": "A love story can never be about full possession. The happy marriage, the requited love, the desire that never dims--these are lucky eventualites but they aren't love stories. Love stories depend on disappointment, on unequal births and feuding families, on matrimonial boredom and at least one cold heart. Love stories, nearly without exception, give love a bad name.We value love not because it's stronger than death but because it's weaker. Say what you want about love: death will finish it. You will not go on loving in the grave, not in any physical way that will at all resemble love as we know it on earth. The perishable nature of love is what gives love its importance in our lives. If it were endless, if it were on tap, love wouldn't hit us the way it does.And we certainly wouldn't write about it."}

{"inputs": "One of the reasons why we crave love, and seek it so desperately, is that love is the only cure for loneliness, and shame, and sorrow. But some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again. Some truths about yourself are so painful that only shame can help you live with them. And some things are just so sad that only your soul can do the crying for you."}
{"inputs": "I like being the girl nobody can have."}
{"inputs": "Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company."}
{"inputs": "When we are in love, we are convinced nobody else will do. But as time goes, others do do, and often do do, much much better."}

His face grew serious. I know I can’t feel your touch, but I feel your love, Nora. Inside me. It means everything to me. I wish I could feel you the same way you feel me, but I have your love. Nothing will ever outweigh that. Some people go their entire lives never feeling the emotions you’ve given me. There is no regret in that."}

{"inputs": "They were kissing. Put like that, and you could be forgiven for presuming that this was a normal kiss, all lips and skin and possibly even a little tongue. You'd miss how he smiled, how his eyes glowed.

{"inputs": "At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own. When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me. I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals almost more than unbridled passion--the craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man--was in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And then--I don't know how it was-- I couldn't bear to let you go--possibly to Arabella again--and so I got to love you, Jude. But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you."}
{"inputs": "We are the ones who take this thing called music and line it up with this thing called time. We are the ticking, we are the pulsing, we are underneath every part of this moment. And by making the moment our own, we are rendering it timeless. There is no audience. There are no instruments. There are only bodies and thoughts and murmurs and looks. It's the concert rush to end all concert rushes, because this is what matters. When the heart races, this is what it's racing towards."}

{"inputs": "...and when one of them meets the other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the other's sight, as I may say, even for a moment..."}

{"inputs": "Sometimes you know you've got a chance with a girl because she wants to fight with you. If the world wasn't so messed up, it wouldn't be like that. If the world was normal, a girl being nice to you would be a good sign, but in the real world, it isn't."}
{"inputs": "True love isn't expressed in passionately whispered words an intimate kiss or a embrace; before two people are married, love is expressed in self-control, patience, even words left unsaid."}
{"inputs": "Not that she didn't love almost every boy she'd ever met, and not that every boy in the world didn't totally love her. It was impossible not to. But she wanted someone to love her and shower her with attention the way only a boy who was completely in love with her could. The rare sort of love. True love. The kind of love she'd never had."}
{"inputs": "I used to think I knew everything. I was a smart person who got things done, and because of that, the higher I climbed, the more I could look down and scoff at what seemed silly or simple, even religion.But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-no matter how smart or accomplished-they cry, they yearn, they hurt.But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things:comfort, love, and a peaceful heart."}

{"inputs": "I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to. Social norms and stuff…what good are social norms, really? I think all they do is project a limited and harmful image of people. It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like."}

{"inputs": "He kissed me wildly, overwhelming me like a giant wave rushing to shore. I was soon lost in the turbulent grasp of his embrace and yet…I knew I was safe. His wild kiss drove me, pushed me, asked me questions I was unwilling to consider. But I was cherished by this dark Poseidon, and though he had the power to crush me utterly, to drown me in the purple depths of his wake, he held me aloft, separate. His passionate kiss changed. It gentled and soothed and entreated. Together we drifted towards a safe harbor. The god of the sea set me down securely on a sandy beach and steadied me as I trembled. Effervescent tingles shot through my limbs delighting me with surges of sparkling sensation like sandy toes tickled by bubbly waves. Finally, the waves moved away and I felt my Poseidon watching me from a distance. We looked at each other knowing we were forever changed by the experience. We both knew that I would always belong to the sea and that I would never be able to part from it and be whole again."}
{"inputs": "Love never dies."}
{"inputs": "I’ve met a man and fallen in love with him. I allowed myself to fall in love for one simple reason: I’m not expecting anything to come of it. I know that, in three months’ time, I’ll be far away and he’ll be just a memory, but I couldn’t stand living without love any longer; I had reached my limit… Generally speaking, these meetings occur when we reach a limit, when we need to die and be reborn emotionally. These meeting are waiting for us, but more often than not, we avoid them happening. If we are desperate, though, if we have nothing to lose, or if we are full of enthusiasm for life, then the unknown reveals itself, and our universe changes directions."}

{"inputs": "Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.'I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in a girl's life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in love coming between her and any man who is kind to her... I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me."}
{"inputs": "It's risky, falling in love. I know that, I answered. I've been in love before. It's like a narcotic. At first it brings the euphoria of complete surrender. The next day, you want more. You're not addicted yet, but you like the sensation, and you think you can still control things. You think about the person you love for two minutes, and forget them for three hours. But then you get used to that person, and you begin to be completely dependent on them. Now you think about him for three hours and forget him for two minutes. If he's not there, you feel like an addict who can't get a fix. And just as addicts steal and humiliate themselves to get what they need, you're willing to do anything for love. What a horrible way to put it, he said."}

{"inputs": "To see and feel one's beloved naked for the first time is one of life's pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition. To make love to the right person makes up for a lot of mistakes."}
{"inputs": "He loved her.Jay Heaton, her best friend since childhood was in love with her. He didn't say it but she knew that it was true.And the part that really freaked her out, the part that caught her completely off guard, is that he wasn't alone.

And it was so weird to even be thinking it but...... she was in love with him too."}

{"inputs": "Most true is it that 'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.' My master’s colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth, — all energy, decision, will, — were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me, — that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me."}

You are so pretty that one of these days I'm going to lose a finger in my garage because I can't concentrate with you so close to me. You are so pretty that I wish you weren't so I wouldn't want to hit every guy at school who looks at you, especially my best friend."}

{"inputs": "When you start to really know someone, all his physical characteristics start to disappear. You begin to dwell in his energy, recognize the scent of his skin. You see only the essence of the person, not the shell. That's why you can't fall in love with beauty. You can lust after it, be infatuated by it, want to own it. You can love it with your eyes and body but not your heart. And that's why, when you really connect with a person's inner self, any physical imperfections disappear, become irrelevant."}

What he said, what she said, what they did, what they did then. Even the times they argued, fought, parted, agonized, rejoined. How they’d loved to cut themselves on each other, taste their own blood. We were ruinous together, she thinks. But how else can we live, these days, except in the midst of ruin? "}

{"inputs": "People accuse me of falling in love easily. It just means that I'm able to see the beauty in most of the people who cross paths with me and I appreciate it for what it is and also for what it isn't. Love is imperfect. Falling for someone's flaws is just as necessary as falling for their strengths. And people like myself, who fall into love easily, are sometimes the loneliest souls around at the end of the day."}
{"inputs": "Your problem is you don't understand what that word means. People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that's holding you back, the person who brings you to your attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then they leave."}

{"inputs": "Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky."}

{"inputs": "People Die...Beauty Fades...Love Changes...And You Will Always Be Alone"}
{"inputs": "Because I trust in the ever-changing climate of the heart. (At least, today I feel that way.) I think it is necessary to have many experiences for the sake of feeling something; for the sake of being challenged, and for the sake of being expressive, to offer something to someone else, to learn what we are capable of."}
{"inputs": "No matter how much you love someone, you still want to have you own way."}

{"inputs": "We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more."}

{"inputs": "To return to love, to get the love we always wanted but never had, to have the love we want but are not prepared to give, we seek romantic relationships. We believe these relationships, more than any other, will rescue and redeem us. True love does have the power to redeem but only if we are ready for redemption. Love saves us only if we want to be saved."}

You’re surrounded by it wherever you go, you walk through it, breathe it...it’s in your lungs, and under your tongue, and between your fingers and toes...

It was a kiss to make angels faint and demons weep...a passionate, demanding, soul-searing kiss that nearly knocked the earth off its axis. Or at least that was how Poppy felt about it."}
{"inputs": "I had never thought I could love another person this much. I also never thought I’d live in such fear of losing another person. Was this how everyone in love felt? Did they all cling tightly to their beloved and wake up terrified in the middle of the night, afraid of being alone? Was that an inevitable way of life when you loved so deeply? Or was it just those of us who walked on a precipice who lived in such panic? "}

{"inputs": "Think of two people, living together day after day, year after year, in this small space, standing elbow to elbow cooking at the same small stove, squeezing past each other on the narrow stairs, shaving in front of the same small bathroom mirror, constantly jogging, jostling, bumping against each other’s bodies by mistake or on purpose, sensually, aggressively, awkwardly, impatiently, in rage or in love – think what deep though invisible tracks they must leave, everywhere, behind them!

{"inputs": "At first we had so much to catch up on we were talking a hundred words a second, barely even listening to the ends of one another's sentences before moving onto the next. And there was laughing. Lots of laughing. Then the laughing stopped and there was this silence. What the hell was it? It was like the world stopped turning in that instant. Like everyone around us had disappeared. Like everything at home was forgotten about. It was as if those few minutes on this world were created just for us and all we could do was look at each other. It was like he was seeing my face for the first time. He looked confused but kind of amused. Exactly how I felt. Because I was sitting on the grass with my best friend Alex, and that was my best friend Alex's face and nose and eyes and lips, but they seemed different. So I kissed him.

{"inputs": "No. Magnus strode toward him. I didn't call you because I'm tired of you only wanting me around when you need something. I'm tired of watching you be in love with someone else-someone, incidentally, who will never love you back. Not the way I do."}

{"inputs": "Now there is one thing I can tell you: you will enjoy certain pleasures you would not fathom now. When you still had your mother you often thought of the days when you would have her no longer. Now you will often think of days past when you had her. When you are used to this horrible thing that they will forever be cast into the past, then you will gently feel her revive, returning to take her place, her entire place, beside you. At the present time, this is not yet possible. Let yourself be inert, wait till the incomprehensible power ... that has broken you restores you a little, I say a little, for henceforth you will always keep something broken about you. Tell yourself this, too, for it is a kind of pleasure to know that you will never love less, that you will never be consoled, that you will constantly remember more and more."}

You were dead, and I brought you back. I upset the balance, not you. I opened the door for Lilith and her stupid ritual. I could have asked for anything, and I asked for you. She tightened her grip on his shirt, her fingers white with cold and pressure. And I would do it again. I love you, Jace Wayland—Herondale—Lightwood—whatever you want to call yourself. I don’t care. I love you and I wil always love you, and pretending it could be any other way is just a waste of time."}
{"inputs": "I am beginning to understand, said the little prince. There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."}
{"inputs": "Love chooses to believe the best about people. It gives them the benefit of the doubt. It refuses to fill in the unknowns with negative assumptions. And when our worst hopes are proven to be true, love makes every effort to deal with them and move forward. As much as possible, love focuses on the positive."}
{"inputs": "So I am not a broken heart. I am not the weight I lost or miles or ran and I am not the way I slept on my doorstep under the bare sky in smell of tears and whiskey because my apartment was empty and if I were to be this empty I wanted something solid to sleep on. Like concrete. I am not this year and I am not your fault.I am muscles building cells, a little every day, because they broke that day, but bones are stronger once they heal and I am smiling to the bus driver and replacing my groceries once a week and I am not sitting for hours in the shower anymore. I am the way a life unfolds and bloom and seasons come and go and I am the way the spring always finds a way to turn even the coldest winter into a field of green and flowers and new life. I am not your fault."}
{"inputs": "Do any of us, except in our dreams, truly expect to be reunited with our hearts' deepest loves, even when they leave us only for minutes, and on the most mundane of errands? No, not at all. Each time they go from our sight we in our secret hearts count them as dead. Having been given so much, we reason, how could we expect not to be brought as low as Lucifer for the staggering presumption of our love? "}
{"inputs": "We need to help people to discover the true meaning of love. Love is generally confused with dependence. Those of us who have grown in true love know that we can love only in proportion to our capacity for independence."}
{"inputs": "Individuals who want to believe that there is no fulfillment in love, that true love does not exist, cling to these assumptions because this despair is actually easier to face than the reality that love is a real fact of life but is absent from their lives."}
{"inputs": "It’s the way he had a cup of tea waiting for me when I woke up. It’s the way he turned on his laptop especially for me to look up all my Internet horoscopes and helped me choose the best one. He knows all the crappy, embarrassing bits about me that I normally try to hide from any man for as long as possible… and he loves me anyway."}
{"inputs": "It was finally becoming clear to her that love wasn't about finding someone perfect to marry. Love was about seeing through to the truth of a person, and accepting all their shades of light and dark. Love was an ability."}
{"inputs": "It can be difficult to leave a long-term relationship, even when our inner-wisdom tells us it's time to let go. At this point, we can choose let go and endure the intense pain of leaving behind the familiar to make way for a new chapter in our life. Or we can stay and suffer a low-grade pain that slowly eats away at our heart and soul, like an emotional cancer. Until we wake up, one day and realize, we are buried so deep in the dysfunction of the relationship that we scarcely remember who we were and what we wanted and needed to be."}

{"inputs": "Everyone has choices to make no one has the right to take those choices away from us. Not even out of love.."}
{"inputs": "I hadn't been out to the hives before, so to start off she gave me a lesson in what she called 'bee yard etiquette'. She reminded me that the world was really one bee yard, and the same rules work fine in both places. Don't be afraid, as no life-loving bee wants to sting you. Still, don't be an idiot; wear long sleeves and pants. Don't swat. Don't even think about swatting. If you feel angry, whistle. Anger agitates while whistling melts a bee's temper. Act like you know what you're doing, even if you don't. Above all, send the bees love. Every little thing wants to be loved."}

{"inputs": "In a strange way, I had fallen in love with my depression. Dr. Sterling was right about that. I loved it because I thought it was all I had. I thought depression was the part of my character that made me worthwhile. I thought so little of myself, felt that I had such scant offerings to give to the world, that the one thing that justified my existence at all was my agony."}
{"inputs": "It's not that I can't live without you; it's that I don't want to. There's a difference. We all make choices in life and I choose you.My heart belongs to you. And I'm not asking for it back, even if you won't want it anymore. I'm just asking for a chance to have your again. I promise I'll be more careful with it this time."}

{"inputs": "This desire to govern a woman -- it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together.... But I do love you surely in a better way then he does. He thought. Yes -- really in a better way. I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms."}
{"inputs": "I have loved to the point of madness; that which is called madness, that which to me, is the only sensible way to love."}
{"inputs": "It was rather beautiful: the way he put her insecurities to sleep. The way he dove into her eyes and starved all the fears and tasted all the dreams she kept coiled beneath her bones."}
{"inputs": "Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man."}
{"inputs": "And we all know love is a glass which makes even a monster appear fascinating."}
{"inputs": "Abuse manipulates and twists a child’s natural sense of trust and love. Her innocent feelings are belittled or mocked and she learns to ignore her feelings. She can’t afford to feel the full range of feelings in her body while she’s being abused—pain, outrage, hate, vengeance, confusion, arousal. So she short-circuits them and goes numb. For many children, any expression of feelings, even a single tear, is cause for more severe abuse. Again, the only recourse is to shut down. Feelings go underground."}
{"inputs": "You are not a perfect woman.You have an evil temper, you’re as blind as a mole, you’re a deplorable poet, and frankly, your French accent could use some work. Supporting himself on his elbows, Leo took her face in his hands. But when I put those things together with the rest of you, it makes you into the most perfectly imperfect woman I’ve ever known."}
{"inputs": "Because love, love is never finished. It circles and circles, the memories out of order and not always complete."}
{"inputs": "There will never be a good time, financially, to get married, unless you're Shaq or Ray Romano. But somehow people manage. If your man is using money as an excuse not to marry you, it's your relationship that's insecure, not his bank account."}
{"inputs": "Love fades. Mine has."}
{"inputs": "I can't promise you an ordinary experience, Kate. I wish I could transform myself into a normal man and be there for you, always, without the trauma that defines my life as the walking dead. Since that isn't possible, I can only reassure you that I will do everything in my power to make it up to you. To give you more than a normal boyfriend could. I have no idea what that will mean, exactly, but I'm looking forward to finding out. With you."}
{"inputs": "Other people spoke, and I tried to keep up with the translations. All the stories were about Dimitri's kindness and strength of character. Even when not out battling the undead, Dimitri had always been there to help those who needed it. Almost everyone could recall sometime that Dimitri had stepped up to help others, going out of his way to do what was right, even in situations that could put him at risk. That was no surprise to me. Dimitri always did the right thing.And it was that attitude that had made me love him so much. I had a similar nature. I too rushed in when others needed me, sometimes when I shouldn't have. Others called me crazy for it, but Dimitri had understood. He'd always understood me, and part of what we'd worked on was how to temper that impulsive need to run into danger with reason and calculation. I had a feeling no one else in this world would ever understand me like he did."}

{"inputs": "I'll tell you something, Harpy, he said, his voice almost a whisper now. It never even occurred to me that we wouldn't make it. And it never occurred to you that we would. You were just waiting for us to go down in flames. I thought we could get through anything."}
{"inputs": "God's definition of what matters is pretty straightforward. He measures our lives by how we love."}
{"inputs": "Well, obviously, she's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who she likes best. Then she'll be feeling guilty, thinking it's an insult to Cedric's memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she'll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can't work out what her feelings towards Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that's all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she's afraid she's going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she's flying so badly. A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode."}
{"inputs": "You are afraid of it because it is stronger than you you hate it because you are afraid of it you love it because you cannot subdue it to your will. Only the unsubduable can be loved."}

{"inputs": "I made such a fool of myself, she lamented.Love does not make you a fool.He didn’t love me back.That does not make you a fool, either.Just tell me … Her voice cracked. When does it stop hurting? Sometimes never."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes love is a surprise, an instant of recognition, a sudden gift at a sudden moment that makes everything different from then on. Some people will say that's not love, that you can't really love someone you don't know. But, I'm not so sure. Love doesn't seem to follow a plan; it's not a series of steps. It can hit with the force of nature--an earthquake, a tidal wave, a storm of wild relentless energy that is beyond your simple attempts at control."}
{"inputs": "When you meet someone so different from yourself, in a good way, you don't even have to kiss to have fireworks go off. It's like fireworks in your heart all the time. I always wondered, do opposites really attract? Now I know for sure they do. I'd grown up going to the library as often as most people go to the grocery store. Jackson didn't need to read about exciting people or places. He went out and found them, or created excitement himself if there wasn't any to be found. The things I like are pretty simple. Burning CDs around themes, like Songs to Get You Groove On and Tunes to Fix a Broken Heart; watching movies; baking cookies; and swimming. It's like I was a salad with a light vinaigrette, and Jackson was a platter of seafood Cajun pasta. Alone, we were good. Together, we were fantastic."}
{"inputs": "Love is like quicksilver in the hand. Leave the fingers open and it stays. Clutch it and it darts away."}
{"inputs": "Smirking, he says, Whatever spell you just tried to cast on me, it didn't work, so I think you need to go back to Hogwarts."}
{"inputs": "I am almost a hundred years old; waiting for the end, and thinking about the beginning.There are things I need to tell you, but would you listen if I told you how quickly time passes? I know you are unable to imagine this.Nevertheless, I can tell you that you will awake someday to find that your life has rushed by at a speed at once impossible and cruel. The most intense moments will seem to have occurred only yesterday and nothing will have erased the pain and pleasure, the impossible intensity of love and its dog-leaping happiness, the bleak blackness of passions unrequited, or unexpressed, or unresolved."}
{"inputs": "...when you decide you want to be with someone forever, you want forever to start right now."}
{"inputs": "Many, many readers have written asking me wistfully about the nature of Sam and Grace's relationship, and I can assure you, that sort is absolutely real. Mutual, respectful, enduring love is completely attainable as long as you swear you won't settle for less."}
{"inputs": "What is love? There is nothing in the world, neither man nor Devil nor any thing, that I hold as suspect as love, for it penetrates the soul more than any other thing. Nothing exists that so fills and binds the heart as love does. Therefore, unless you have those weapons that subdue it, the soul plunges through love into an immense abyss."}
{"inputs": "That must be love: when everything else in the world could implode and you wouldn't care as long as you had that one person standing beside you."}
{"inputs": "They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine."}
{"inputs": "I hold the bottle out into the rain and watch as the steady flow slowly fills it. When there is enough, enough that Beth can clearly see, I close the bottle and hand it to her.She raises a skeptical eyebrow, but accepts the bottle. It's our rain Beth. Her head barely shakes to show her confusion while I rub the back of my neck and search for my courage. I told you I loved you in this rain and when you doubt my words, I want you to look at this bottle."}
{"inputs": "I'll always want him. Until every sun goes dark in every sky, until I am nothing more than long-forgotten cosmic dust, I will want him. And even then I suspect my particles will long for his."}
{"inputs": "Say it, I gritted out.The High Lord of the Night Court is your mate."}
{"inputs": "This is how the girl who couldn't speak and the man who couldn't see fell in love."}
{"inputs": "Me quota ang pag-ibig. Sa bawat limang umiibig, isa lang ang magiging maligaya. Ang iba, iibig sa di sila iniibig. Iibig nang di natututo. O iibig sa wala. O di iibig kailanman."}
{"inputs": "I miss you.I miss you. I miss you, I miss you.Be ready, because when I see you, I'll never let you go again."}
{"inputs": "He said that we belonged together because he was born with a flower and I was born with a butterfly and that flowers and butterflies need each other for survival."}
{"inputs": "You said you didn't want to get involved with me, that one of us would get hurt and how you couldn't bear it. Well that just isn't good enough..Look what happens to people just living their lives. They get hurt, it's not fair they get hurt but they do, all the time, no matter how careful they are. Somebody can just just come along and hurt them, for no stupid reason.."}
{"inputs": "For many, love is a two-sided coin. It can strengthen or stifle, expand or enfeeble, perfect or pauperize. When love is returned, we soar. We are taken to heights unseen, where it delights, invigorates, and beautifies. When love is spurned, we feel crippled, disconsolate, and bereaved. Polish the coin and you will see only requited love on both sides. I was destined to love you and I will belong to you forever."}
{"inputs": "Loving you forever can't be wrong. Even though you're not here, can't move on"}
{"inputs": "I love you so much that nothing can matter to me - not even you...Only my love- not your answer. Not even your indifference"}
{"inputs": "Just for the record, she still loves you. She wouldn't bother to torture you if she didn't. "}
{"inputs": "You can love somebody without it being like that. You keep them a stranger, a stranger who's a friend."}
{"inputs": "Jesus Christ lived in the midst of his enemies. At the end all his disciples deserted him. On the Cross he was utterly alone, surrounded by evildoers and mockers. For this cause he had come, to bring peace to the enemies of God. So the Christian, too, belongs not in the seclusion of a cloistered life but in the thick of foes. There is his commission, his work. 'The kingdom is to be in the midst of your enemies. And he who will not suffer this does not want to be of the Kingdom of Christ; he wants to be among friends, to sit among roses and lilies, not with the bad people but the devout people. O you blasphemers and betrayers of Christ! If Christ had done what you are doing who would ever have been spared' (Luther)."}
{"inputs": "I asked you here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."}
{"inputs": "Mysteries of attraction could not always be explained through logic. Sometimes the fractures in two separate souls became the very hinges that held them together."}
{"inputs": "It was not the passion that was new to her, it was the yearning adoration. She knew she had always feared it, for it left her helpless; she feared it still, lest if she adored him too much, then she would lose herself, become effaced, and she did not want to be effaced, a slave, like a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration, yet she would not at once fight against it."}
{"inputs": "Falling in love in a Christian way is to say, 'I am excited about your future and I want to be part of getting you there. I'm signing up for the journey with you. Would you sign up for the journey to my true self with me? It's going to be hard but I want to get there."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company."}
{"inputs": "I delete the picture of him from my phone; I delete his number. I think that if I just delete him enough, it will be like none of it ever happened and my heart won't hurt so badly"}
{"inputs": "The Quiet WorldIn an effort to get people to lookinto each other’s eyes more, and also to appease the mutes, the government has decidedto allot each person exactly one hundred and sixty-seven words, per day.When the phone rings, I put it to my ear without saying hello. In the restaurant I point at chicken noodle soup.I am adjusting well to the new way.Late at night, I call my long distance lover, I only used fifty-nine today. When she doesn’t respond, I know she’s used up all her words, thirty-two and a third times.After that, we just sit on the line and listen to each other breathe."}
{"inputs": "I have done it, she says. At first I do not understand. But then I see the tomb, and the marks she has made on the stone. A C H I L L E S, it reads. And beside it, P A T R O C L U S. Go, she says. He waits for you. In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun."}
{"inputs": "My life-my whole life- take it, and do with it what you will. I love you-love you as I have never loved any living thing. From the moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly, madly! You didn't know it then-you know it now."}
{"inputs": "Who fixes broken people? Is it only other broken people, ones who've already been ruined? And do we need to be fixed? It was the messiness and hurt in our pasts that drove us, and that same hurt connected us at a subdermal level, the kind of scars written so deeply in your cells that you can't even see them anymore, only recognize them in someone else."}
{"inputs": "The purpose of relationship is not to have another who might complete you, but to have another with whom you might share your completeness."}
{"inputs": "The knowledge that she would never be loved in return acted upon her ideas as a tide acts upon cliffs."}
{"inputs": "I loved him as we always love for the first time"}
{"inputs": "It is that we are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never no helplessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object of its love."}
{"inputs": "Her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world."}
{"inputs": "Our lips met hungrily, and his clever artistic hands wrapped around my hips. A sudden buzz from my regular cell phone startled me from the kissing. Don't, said Adrian, his eyes ablaze and breathing ragged. What if there's a crisis at school? I asked. What if Angeline 'accidentally' stole one of the campus buses and drove it into the library? Why would she do that? Are you saying she wouldn't? He sighed. Go check it."}
{"inputs": "What barrier is there that love cannot break? "}
{"inputs": "The most introspective of souls are often those that have been hurt the most."}
{"inputs": "My mother used to tell me that when push comes to shove, you always know who to turn to. That being a family isn't a social construct but an instinct."}
{"inputs": "You said move on, where do I go? "}
{"inputs": "Infantile love follows the principle: I love because I am loved. Mature love follows the principle: I am loved because I love. Immature love says: I love you because I need you. Mature love says: I need you because I love you."}
{"inputs": "Love is like a good cake; you never know when it's coming, but you'd better eat it when it does! "}
{"inputs": "Don't you know that love isn't just going to bed? Love isn't an act, it's a whole life. It's staying with her now because she needs you; it's knowing you and she will still care about each other when sex and daydreams, fights and futures -- when all that's on the shelf and done with. Love -- why, I'll tell you what love is: it's you at seventy-five and her at seventy-one, each of you listening for the other's step in the next room, each afraid that a sudden silence, a sudden cry, could mean a lifetime's talk is over."}
{"inputs": "I understood that as much as I had resisted the outside, as much as I had constricted my life, as much as I had closed and narrowed the channels into me, there were still many takers for the quiet heart."}
{"inputs": "I don't want to live, I want to love first and live incidentally."}
{"inputs": "Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted."}
{"inputs": "Love cannot live where there is no trust."}
{"inputs": "I realized I’m in love. It's always been right in front of me."}
{"inputs": "Thank you...for gracing my life with your lovely presence, for adding the sweet measure of your soul to my existence."}
{"inputs": "The thing is, that world doesn't exist. All growing up means is that your realize no one will come along to fix things. No one will come along to save you."}
{"inputs": "You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving."}
{"inputs": "Love is like the sea. It's a moving thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from the shore it meets, and it's different with every shore."}
{"inputs": "And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold."}
{"inputs": "That's what I love about Aibileen, she can take the most complicated things in life and wrap them up so small and simple, they'll fit right in your pocket."}
{"inputs": "When I like people immensely I never tell their names to anyone. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy."}
{"inputs": "Everything want to be loved. Us sing and dance and holler, just trying to be loved."}
{"inputs": "Maybe it's just hiding somewhere. Or gone on a trip to come home. But falling in love is always a pretty crazy thing. It might appear out of the blue and just grab you. Who knows — maybe even tomorrow."}
{"inputs": "You want to take me to a movie? I asked. Well, not really, he said. What I really want is for you to be my girlfriend. But I thought saying that might scare you off."}
{"inputs": "I believein love at first sightbut I will always believe that the peoplewe lovewe have loved before.Many, many, many times beforeand when we stumblethrough grace and circumstance and that brilliant illusion of choiceto finally meet them again, we feel it fastereach time through.The one glance that set life alightis two sets of two eyesstaring through the layersof lifetimes and stolen glancesand first kisses and hands held;the brace against the weight and unrelenting tideof waiting.I believein love at first sightbut am not burdened with the misconceptionthat it's a first sightat all."}
{"inputs": "The bottom line is that we never fall for the person we're supposed to."}
{"inputs": "Without love we all like birds with broken wings."}
{"inputs": "I can't--I can't think about anything or anyone else, he whispered. A hand drifted up, dragging back through his hair. I can't think straight when you're around. I can't sleep. It feels like I can't breathe--I just-- Liam, please, I begged. You're tired. You're barely over being sick. Let's just... Can we just go back to the others? I love you. He turned toward me, that agonized expression still on his face. I love you every second of everyday, and I don't understand why, or how to make it stop-- He looked wild with pain; it pinned me in place, even before what he had said registered in my mind. I know it's wrong; I know it down to my damn bones. And I feel like I'm sick. I'm trying to be a good person, but I can't. I can't do this anymore."}
{"inputs": "It's a very brave thing to fall in love. You have to be willing to trust somebody else with your whole being, and that's very difficult, really difficult and very brave."}
{"inputs": "There’s something about arriving in new cities, wandering empty streets with no destination. I will never lose the love for the arriving, but I'm born to leave."}
{"inputs": "I'll come and make love to you at five o'clock. If I'm late start without me."}
{"inputs": "I gave you my heart, but it wasn't enough."}
{"inputs": "I’ve been working hard to become the kind of man she needs, the kind of man she already believes me to be."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes, remembering hurts too much."}
{"inputs": "Does that count as an argument? Can we kiss and make up now? It was only half an argument.Fine. Then, you kiss and I’ll make up.I laughed until he effectively shut me up with his lips."}
{"inputs": "You know I love you, right? The urge to kiss her goodbye was so strong that I almost broke our rules.She smiled, beautiful and golden in the late morning light. Not as much as I love you.Oh, man. This is my dream come true: having an ‘I love you more’ debate. Here, I’ll start. I love you more. Your turn.Sydney laughed and opened the door. I’ve taken debate classes. You’d lose to my logic."}
{"inputs": "It always struck me in years after how bizarre it was, how two people could look at one another with such tenderness and complete love, and how quickly that could dissolve into nothing but bitterness."}
{"inputs": "All any of us wanted, really, was to know that we counted. That someone else's life would not have been as rich without us here."}
{"inputs": "When someone beats a rug, the blows are not against the rug, but against the dust in it."}
{"inputs": "the world is not a pleasant place to be without someone to hold and be held by."}

I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.''One only understands the things that one tames, ' said the fox. 'Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me.''What must I do, to tame you? ' asked the little prince.'You must be very patient, ' replied the fox. 'First you will sit down at a little distance from me-like that-in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."}

{"inputs": "If you didn't remember something happening, was it because it never had happened? Or because you wished it hadn't? "}
{"inputs": "It never gets easier, missing you. And sometimes I wonder if it ever will."}
{"inputs": "That was when it was all made painfully clear to me. When you are a child, there is joy. There is laughter. And most of all, there is trust. Trust in your fellows. When you are an adult...then comes suspicion, hatred, and fear. If children ran the world, it would be a place of eternal bliss and cheer. Adults run the world; and there is war, and enmity, and destruction unending. Adults who take charge of things muck them up, and then produce a new generation of children and say, The children are the hope of the future. And they are right. Children are the hope of the future. But adults are the damnation of the present, and children become adults as surely as adults become worm food. Adults are the death of hope."}
{"inputs": "Waiting is erotic"}
{"inputs": "Love, and you shall be loved."}
{"inputs": "What we all want, really, is to be loved. That craving drives our worst behavior."}
{"inputs": "I don’t understand the hatred and fear of gays and bisexuals and lesbians…it’s a concept I honestly cannot grasp. To me, it’s not who you love…a man, a woman, what have you…it’s the fact that you love. That is all that truly matters."}
{"inputs": "I’d missed him so much, it almost hurt. It started the moment I left the Keep and nagged at me all day. Every day I had to fight with myself to keep from making up bullshit reasons to call the Keep so I could hear his voice. My only saving grace was that Curran wasn’t handling this whole mating thing any better. Yesterday he’d called me at the office claiming that he couldn’t find his socks. We talked for two hours."}
{"inputs": "Love is not something you protect. It’s something you risk."}
{"inputs": "If in thirst you drink water from a cup, you see God in it. Those who are not in love with God will see only their own faces in it."}
{"inputs": "One of the few downsides to being awakened is that we no longer require sleep; therefore we also no longer dream. It's a shame, because if I could dream, I know I'd dream about you.I'd dream about the way you smell and how your dark hair feels like silk between my fingers. I'd dream about the smoothness of your skin and the fierceness of your lips when we kiss. Without dreams, I have to be content with my own imagination– which is almost as good. I can picture all of those things perfectly, as well as how it'll be when I take your life from this world."}
{"inputs": "I look at you, and I think about you, and ... I don't know. No one has ever confounded me the way you do."}
{"inputs": "But I was youngand didn’t know betterand someone should have told me to capture every secondevery kiss & every nightBecause now I’m sitting here alone and it’s getting really hard to breath because tears are growing in my throat and they want to break out, but there are peoplewatchingand I just want to be somewhere silentsomewhere stillBut still I don’t want to be alone because I’m scared and lonelyand I don’t understandBecause I was alone my whole lifeMy whole lifeI was so damn lonely and I was content with thatbecause I liked myself and my own company and I didn’t need anyoneI thoughtBut then there was you .. ...So, someone should have told me that love is for those few brave who can handle the unbearable emptiness, the unbearable guilt and lack of oneself, Because I lost myself to someone I loveand I might get myself back one daybut it will take time, it will take time.This is gonna take some time.I wish someone would have told me this.Someone should have told me this."}
{"inputs": "Love was the most savage monster of all."}
{"inputs": "I miss us too. I always have and I probably always will. Sometimes there are no happy endings. No matter what, I'll be losing something, someone. But maybe that's what it all comes down to. Love, not as a surge of passion, but as a choice to commit to something, someone, no matter what obstacles or temptations stand in the way. And maybe making that choice again and again, day in and day out, year after year, says more about love than never having a choice to make at all."}
{"inputs": "Choice or no, my heart is his."}
{"inputs": "Here's a news flash for the ladies: for every one of you who thinks we all want a girl like Angelina Jolie, all skinny elbows and angles, the truth is, we'd rather curl up with someone like Charlotte - a woman who's soft when a guy wraps his arms around her; a woman who might have a smear of flour on her shirt the whole day and not notice or care, not even when she goes out to meet with the PTA; a woman who doesn't feel like an exotic vacation but is the home we can't wait to come back to."}
{"inputs": "Okay, then I’ll just say I love you. There is nothing in this world more important to me than you are. I’m only content when you’re near. My whole purpose is to be what you need me to be. It’s not poetry, but it’s from my heart. Will that do? "}
{"inputs": "The spiritualization of sensuality is called love: it is a great triumph over Christianity."}
{"inputs": "Two seconds later, the sound of an alarm filled my ears. ''What did you do? '' I said over the noise as he backed up towards the bathroom door. ''The girl who gave you the note? ''''Yes...''''I caught her staring at my lighter.''I blinked. ''You gave a child, in a psych ward , a lighter? ''His eyes crinkled at the corners. ''She seemed trustworthy.''''You're sick, '' I said, but smiled.''Hey, nobody's perfect. '' Noah smiled back."}
{"inputs": "He wanted to take his love back from her so badly. The old techniques didn’t work anymore. In fact, they’d never worked. How do you stop loving someone? It was one of the world’s more brutal mysteries. The more you tried, the less it worked."}
{"inputs": "From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man."}
{"inputs": "It's easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die."}
{"inputs": "I reserve the right to love many different people at once, and to change my prince often."}
{"inputs": "Someone can be madly in love with you and still not be ready. They can love you in a way you have never been loved and still not join you on the bridge. And whatever their reasons you must leave. Because you never ever have to inspire anyone to meet you on the bridge. You never ever have to convince someone to do the work to be ready. There is more extraordinary love, more love that you have never seen, out here in this wide and wild universe. And there is the love that will be ready."}
{"inputs": "Not like this. He wanted it to be real."}
{"inputs": "If you listen to the wind very carefully, you'll be able to hear me whisper my love for you."}
{"inputs": "The fiercest anger of all, the most incurable, Is that which rages in the place of dearest love."}
{"inputs": "I would never let anyone else borrow my heart if I know there’s a chance in hell you might want it back."}
{"inputs": "He experienced the singular pleasure of watching people he loved fall in love with other people he loved."}
{"inputs": "I could still smell her on my fur. It clung to me, a memory of another world.I was drunk with it, with the scent of her. I'd got too close.The smell of summer on her skin, the half-recalled cadence of her voice, the sensation of her fingers on my fur. Every bit of me sang with the memory of her closeness.Too close.I couldn't stay away."}
{"inputs": "Please, he says. I'm begging you to stop. I still. I can't stomach your pain, he says. I can feel it so strongly and it's making me crazy- please, he says to me. Don't be sad. Or hurt. Or guilty. You've done nothing wrong. I'm sorry- Don't be sorry, either, he says. God, the only reason I'm not going to kill Kent for this is because I know it would only upset you more."}
{"inputs": "You can’t, if you can’t feel it, if it neverRises from the soul, and swaysThe heart of every single hearer, With deepest power, in simple ways.You’ll sit forever, gluing things together, Cooking up a stew from other’s scraps, Blowing on a miserable fire, Made from your heap of dying ash.Let apes and children praise your art, If their admiration’s to your taste, But you’ll never speak from heart to heart, Unless it rises up from your heart’s space."}
{"inputs": "The truth was I knew, after all those flat January days, that I deserved better. I deserved I love yous and kiwi fruits and warriors coming to my door, besotted with love. I deserved pictures of my face in a thousand expressions, and the warmth of a baby's kick beneath my hand. I deserved to grow, and to change, to become all the girls I could be over the course of my life, each one better than the last."}
{"inputs": "A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love, however badly he may have treated her."}
{"inputs": "I realized when you look at your mother, you are looking at the purest love you will ever know."}
{"inputs": "I just don't see why the past has to matter."}
{"inputs": "You think I'm cute? He said thinkly, pulling on her hand.She was glad he couldn't see her face. I think you're... Beautiful. Breathtaking. Like the person in a Greek myth who makes one of the gods stop caring about being a god."}
{"inputs": "Some people feel love in their hearts, Julie. Some of us feel it all way into our souls. We're the ones who can't forget."}
{"inputs": "If you have reasons to love someone, you don’t love them."}
{"inputs": "Better to put your heart on the line, risk everything, and walk away with nothing than play it safe. Love is a lot of things, but safe isn’t one of them."}
{"inputs": "So many believe that it is love that grows, but it is the knowing that grows and love simply expands to contain it."}
{"inputs": "Love is blind, they say--but isn't it more that love makes us see too much? Isn't it more that love floods our brain with sights and sounds, so that everything looks bigger, brighter, more lovely than ever before? "}
{"inputs": "Falling into ruin was a bit like falling in love: Both descents stripped you bare and left you as you were at your core. And both endings are equally painful."}
{"inputs": "I want my world to start and end with you."}
{"inputs": "he is both the source of my happiness and the one i want to share it with."}
{"inputs": "They kissed for the first time then in the cold spring rain, though neither one of them now knew that it was raining. Tristran's heart pounded in his chest as if it was not big enough to contain all the joy that it held. He opened his eyes as he kissed the star. Her sky-blue eyes stared back into his, and in her eyes he could see no parting from her."}
{"inputs": "And when she at last came out, her eyes were dry. Her parents stared up from their silent breakfast at her. They both started to rise but she put a hand out, stopped them. ‘I can care for myself, please, ’ and she set about getting some food. They watched her closely. In point of fact, she had never looked as well. She had entered her room as just an impossibly lovely girl. The woman who emerged was a trifle thinner, a great deal wiser, and an ocean sadder. This one understood the nature of pain, and beneath the glory of her features, there was character, and a sure knowledge of suffering. She was eighteen. She was the most beautiful woman in a hundred years. She didn’t seem to care. ‘You’re all right? ’ her mother asked. Buttercup sipped her cocoa. ‘Fine, ’ she said. ‘You’re sure? ’ her father wondered. ‘Yes, ’ Buttercup replied. There was a very long pause. ‘But I must never love again.’ She never did."}
{"inputs": "I want him to love me as much as I love him."}
{"inputs": "She knew whose love she doubted. It wasn't her parents' and it wasn't her friends: It was her own. "}
{"inputs": "I could feel the warmth of his presence as if a soft blanket had been wrapped around my soul, around my heart. It held me and protected me. It sheltered me and I knew I wasn’t alone anymore."}
{"inputs": "You have a beautiful laugh. Like the promise of tomorrow."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes you have to learn to love what's good for you."}
{"inputs": "Faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the windows which hope has opened."}
{"inputs": "I wanted movement and not a calm course of existence. I wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love."}
{"inputs": "It isn't about love, Vee said. It's about fun."}
{"inputs": "You don't have to say I love you to say I love you, you said with a shrug. All you have to do is say my name and I know. ... Can't you hear it? you said. When you love someone, you say their name different. Like it's safe inside your mouth."}
{"inputs": "And he knew that at that moment, they understood each other perfectly, and when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say ‘be careful’ or ‘don’t do it’, but she would accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him."}

{"inputs": "Love all God’s creation, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf, every ray of light. Love the animals, love the plants, love each separate thing. If thou love each thing thou wilt perceive the mystery of God in all; and when once thou perceive this, thou wilt thenceforward grow every day to a fuller understanding of it: until thou come at last to love the whole world with a love that will then be all-embracing and universal."}
{"inputs": "I loved him.I couldn't pinpoint what made me so certain, but I knew it then, as surely as I knew my name or the color of the sky or any fact written in a book.Could he feel it, too? Maxon broke the kiss and looked at me. You're so pretty when you are a mess. I laughed nervously. Thank you. For that and for the rain and for not giving up. He ran his fingers along my cheek and nose and chin. You're worth it. I don't think that you get that. You're worth it to me."}
{"inputs": "He shook his head, just looking at me. - What? I asked.- Nothing he said.- Why are you looking at me like that? Augustus half smiled. Because you`re beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. A brief awkward silence ensued. Augustus plowed through: I mean, particularly given that, as you so deliciously pointed out, all of this will end in oblivion and everything. I kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said, I`m not beau- - You are like a millennial Natalie Portman. Like V for Vendetta Natalie Portman. - Never seen it. - Really? he asked. Pixie-haired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and can`t help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble. It`s your autobiography, so far as I can tell. His every syllable flirted. Honestly, he kind of turned me on. I didn`t even know that guys could turn me on - not, like, in real life."}
{"inputs": "After dinner or lunch or whatever it was -- with my crazy 12-hour night I was no longer sure what was what -- I said, Look, baby, I'm sorry, but don't you realize that this job is driving me crazy? Look, let's give it up. Let's just lay around and make love and take walks and talk a little. Let's go to the zoo. Let's look at animals. Let's drive down and look at the ocean. It's only 45 minutes. Let's play games in the arcades. Let's go to the races, the Art Museum, the boxing matches. Let's have friends. Let's laugh. This kind of life like everybody else's kind of life: it's killing us."}

{"inputs": "Just knowing you exist changed the world for me."}
{"inputs": "When I talk about unrequited love, most of you probably think about romantic love, but there are many other kinds of love that are not adequately returned, if they are returned at all. An angry adolescent may not love her mother back as her mother loves her; an abusive father doesn't return the innocent open love of his young child. But grief is the ultimate unrequieted love. However hard and however long we love someone who has died, they can never love us back. At least that is how it feels..."}

{"inputs": "I remember when your name was just another name that rolled without thought off my tongue.Now, I can’t look at your name without an abundance of sentiment attached to each lettter.Your name, which I played with so carelessly, so easily, has somehow become sacred to my lips.A name I won’t throw around lightheartedly or repeat without deep thought.And if ever I speak of you, I use the English language to describe who you were to me. You are nameless, because those letters grouped together in that familiar form….. carries too much meaning for my capricious heart."}
{"inputs": "A gentleman holds my hand.A man pulls my hair.A soulmate will do both."}
{"inputs": "Clare, I want to tell you, again, I love you. Our love has been the thread through the labyrinth, the net under the high-wire walker, the only real thing in this strange life of mine that I could ever trust. Tonight I feel that my love for you has more density in this world than I do, myself: as though it could linger on after me and surround you, keep you, hold you."}
{"inputs": "The only difference between falling in love and being in love is that your heart already knows how you feel, but your mind is too stubborn to admit it."}

{"inputs": "All the fires of hell could burn for a thousand years and it wouldn't equal what I feel for you in one minute of the day. I love you so much there is no pleasure in it. Nothing but torment. Because if I could dilute what I feel for you to the mil­lionth part, it would still be enough to kill you. And even if it drives me mad, I would rather see you live in the arms of that cold, soulless bastard than die in mine, Merripen said to Win."}
{"inputs": "Simon: So were you following me? Or is it just an amazing coincidence that you happened to be on the roof of a building I was walking by when I got attacked? Jace: I was following you.Simon: Is this the part where you tell me you're secretly in love with me? "}
{"inputs": "Dimitri's voice snapped my attention back to him. That's Adrian Ivashkov. He said the name the same way everyone else did. Yeah, I know. This is the second time I've seen you with him. Yeah, I replied glibly. We hang out sometimes. Dimitri arched an eyebrow, then jerked his head back toward where we'd come from. You hang out in his room a lot? Several retorts popped into my head, and then a golden one took precedence. What happens between him and me is none of your business. I managed a tone very similar to the one he'd used on me when making a similar comment about him and Tasha. Actually, as long as you're at the Academy, what you do is my business. Not my personal life. You don't have any say in that."}
{"inputs": "When we first met, I didn't want to get involved with anyone. I didn't have the time or energy, and I wasn't sure that I was ready for it. But you were so good to me, and I got swept up in that. And little by little, I found myself falling in love with you."}
{"inputs": "What sexual preference do you hope she has? Happiness. Isnt that cool? "}
{"inputs": "Love is happiness, but only when you believe it will last forever. Even though every time it turns out to be a lie, it’s only faith that gives love its strength and its joy."}
{"inputs": "Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death."}
{"inputs": "He'd only been gone two seconds, but the room got brighter when they were together, as if they were two elements that became brilliant in proximity. At Sam's clumsy efforts to carry the vacuum, Grace smiled a new smile that I thought only he ever got, and he shot her a withering look full of the sort of subtext you could only get from a lot of conversations whispered after dark.It made me think of Isabel, back at her house. We didn't have what Sam and Grace had. We weren't even close to having it. I didn't think what we had could get to this, even if you gave it a thousand years."}

{"inputs": "If you don't like Cinderella because she seems so naive and weak, listen to this quote from the Walt himself: She believed in dreams, all right, but she also believed in doing something about them. When Prince Charming didn't come along, she went over to the palace and got him."}
{"inputs": "Love doesn’t have to be on Valentine’s Day. It doesn’t have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesn’t have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesn’t have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.It just has to be."}
{"inputs": "Oh, don't mind me, came an extremely sarcastic voice near the wall. You two go ahead and make out–I'll just sit here and bleed quietly."}
{"inputs": "You make me smile like the sun, fall out bed, sing like a bird, dizzy in my head. Spin like a record crazy on a sunday night. You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breath, shine like the sun buzz like a bee, just the thought of you can drive me wild. Oh you make me smile. -Uncle Kracker-"}
{"inputs": "I give her the only honest and true answer I have. You're where I want to be."}
{"inputs": "I don't understand how I can know so little about love and how it works. How I can be so bad at it when it's all I've ever wanted.All I've ever known is about leaving or being left."}
{"inputs": "All too often women believe it is a sign of commitment, an expression of love, to endure unkindness or cruelty, to forgive and forget. In actuality, when we love rightly we know that the healthy, loving response to cruelty and abuse is putting ourselves out of harm's way."}
{"inputs": "I think sometimes when we find love we pretend it away, or ignore it, or tell ourselves we’re imagining it. Because it is the most painful kind of hope there is."}
{"inputs": "Dustfinger still clearly remembered the feeling of being in love for the first time. How vulnerable his heart had suddenly been! Such a trembling, quivering thing, happy and miserably unhappy at once."}
{"inputs": "To love makes one solitary."}
{"inputs": "And besides . . . I don’t want to leave you. Er, you guys.He smiled, and it lit up his whole face. Well, ‘we’ are certainly happy to hear that. Oh, and I’m also happy to watch our darling little love child dragon while you’re in St. Louis.I grinned back."}
{"inputs": "True love always makes a man better, no matter what woman inspires it."}
{"inputs": "There are all kinds of ways for a relationship to be tested, even broken, some, irrevocably; it’s the endings we’re unprepared for."}
{"inputs": "If he can't handle you at your worst then he does not deserve you at your best. Real love means seeing beyond the words spoken out of pain, and instead seeing a person's soul."}
{"inputs": "Nothing is more curious and awkward than the relationship of two people who only know each other with their eyes — who meet and observe each other daily, even hourly and who keep up the impression of disinterest either because of morals or because of a mental abnormality. Between them there is listlessness and pent-up curiosity, the hysteria of an unsatisfied, unnaturally suppressed need for communion and also a kind of tense respect. Because man loves and honors man as long as he is not able to judge him, and desire is a product of lacking knowledge."}
{"inputs": "When what you want is a relationship, and not a person, get a dog."}
{"inputs": "We looked at each other for a minute, not saying anything, but I could feel the air between us shift. It became thick, sultry, and tangible—like when the air changes right before a storm. I could feel its power envelop me as it brushed across my skin. Even though I couldn’t see it, I knew a storm was coming."}
{"inputs": "After all, a woman who doesn't love cats is never going to be make a man happy."}
{"inputs": "Then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before...and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world."}
{"inputs": "A broken heart in real life isn't half as dreadful as it is in books. It's a good deal like a bad tooth, though you won't think THAT a very romantic simile. It takes spells of aching and gives you a sleepless night now and then, but between times it lets you enjoy life and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the matter with it."}
{"inputs": "You can give without loving, but you can never love without giving."}
{"inputs": "Soul connections are not often found and are worth every bit of fight left in you to keep."}
{"inputs": "I wanted to tell her that I loved her, and not in the complicated way I loved our parents, but in a simple way I never had to think about. I loved her like breathing."}
{"inputs": "Love can rebuild the world, they say, so everything's possible when it comes to love."}
{"inputs": "He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark."}
{"inputs": "The heart makes its choices without weighing the consequences. It doesn't look ahead to the lonely nights that follow."}
{"inputs": "—I don't want to lose you—Then why are you the one that keeps letting go? "}
{"inputs": "And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course."}
{"inputs": "Disappointments in love, even betrayals and losses, serve the soul at the very moment they seem in life to be tragedies. The soul is partly in time and partly in eternity. We might remember the part that resides in eternity when we feel despair over the part that is in life."}
{"inputs": "Kisses open doors, I've noticed. That one gesture can unlock secrets, ease open feelings. It can't be prevented--these kisses just are. It's how they work. They break into basements you never knew you had."}
{"inputs": "Modern man has transformed himself into a commodity; he experiences his life energy as an investment with which he should make the highest profit, considering his position and the situation on the personality market. He is alienated from himself, from his fellow men and from nature. His main aim is profitable exchange of his skills, knowledge, and of himself, his personality package with others who are equally intent on a fair and profitable exchange. Life has no goal except the one to move, no principle except the one of fair exchange, no satisfaction except the one to consume.p97."}
{"inputs": "What’s wrong is that every morning and every night, I lie in bed wondering why you’re not beside me."}
{"inputs": "You left with my soul in your fists and my heart in your teeth, and I don’t want either of them back. ~Ben"}
{"inputs": "I’m not the kind of man to bottle up my feelings, Kells. I don’t sit up in my room pining away, writing love poems. I’m not a dreamer. I’m a fighter. I’m a man of action, and it will take all of my self-control not to fight for this. When something needs to be done, I do it. When I feel something, I act on it. I don’t see any reason why Ren deserves to get the girl of his dreams and I don’t. It doesn’t seem fair that this happens to me twice."}
{"inputs": "We all know interspecies romance is weird."}
{"inputs": "Perhaps people like us cannot love. Ordinary people can - that is their secret. "}
{"inputs": "Everything happens for a reason and, something better will come along for me! "}
{"inputs": "May I kiss you then? On this miserable paper? I might as well open the window and kiss the night air."}
{"inputs": "I shouldn't have to be a liar to make someone love me. I shouldn't be so afraid of losing someone that I'll do anything to make them stay."}
{"inputs": "That's the big picture, your happiness. And health. You should never care what a man thinks of you -- until he demonstrates to you that he cares about making you happy. If he isn't trying to make you happy, then send him back from whence he came because winning him over will have no benefit. At the end of the day, happines, joy...and yes...your emotional stability...those comprise the only measuring stick you really need to have."}
{"inputs": "And I got out of there without punching anyone, kicking anyone, or breaking down in tears. Some days the small victories are all you achieve."}
{"inputs": "Love is a force unto itself, sayyidi. For love, people consider the unthinkable...and often achieve the impossible. I would not sneer at its power."}
{"inputs": "The strength of a love is always misjudged if we evaluate it by its immediate cause and not the stress that went before it, the dark and hollow space full of disappointment and loneliness that precedes all the great events in the heart's history."}
{"inputs": "Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won’t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up."}
{"inputs": "The desire to go home that is a desire to be whole, to know where you are, to be the point of intersection of all the lines drawn through all the stars, to be the constellation-maker and the center of the world, that center called love. To awaken from sleep, to rest from awakening, to tame the animal, to let the soul go wild, to shelter in darkness and blaze with light, to cease to speak and be perfectly understood."}
{"inputs": "I love you for who you are, not who the world thinks you should be."}
{"inputs": "Mine was the twilight and the morning. Mine was a world of rooftops and love songs."}
{"inputs": "There is lust and then there is love. They are related, but still very different things. To indulge in one requires little but honeyed speech and a change of clothes; to obtain the other, by contrast, a man must give up his rib. In return, his woman will undo the sin of Eve, and bring him back into Paradise."}
{"inputs": "No human should mislead another by promising them something they know to be untrue."}
{"inputs": "I know what I have given you... I do not know what you have received."}
{"inputs": "I wish the night would end, I wish the day'd begin, I wish it would rain or snow, or the wind would blow, or the grass would grow, I wish I had yesterday, I wish there were games to play..."}
{"inputs": "People fall in love without reason, without even wanting to. You can't predict it. That's love."}
{"inputs": "You promised, Seaweed Brain. We would not get separated! Ever again! You’re impossible! Love you too! "}
{"inputs": "I don't care, said Seth. I would have done it. I would have sold my soul for you. You and me...I told you. Something's always going to keep us near each other...even if we aren't together."}
{"inputs": "He didn't marry you to become king. He became king because he wanted to marry you."}
{"inputs": "I want your most vital organ. I want it to be mine."}
{"inputs": "There’s always that one guy who gets a hold on you. Not like your best friend’s brother who gets you in a headlock kind of hold. Or the little kid you’re babysitting who attaches himself to your leg kind of hold. I’m talking epic. Life changing. The can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t do your homework, can’t stop giggling, can’t remember anything but his smile kind of hold. Like, Wesley and Buttercup proportions. Harry and Sally. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The kind of hold in all your favorite ’80s songs, like the Must Have Been Loves, the Take My Breath Aways, the Eternal Flames—the ones you sing into a hairbrush-microphone at the top of your lungs with your best friends on a Saturday night."}
{"inputs": "He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."}
{"inputs": "Three years? That's a thousand tomorrows, ma'am."}
{"inputs": "I love him wholly and unconditionally and without reservation. I love him enough to sacrifice a friendship. I love him enough to accept my own happiness and use it, in turn, to make him happy back."}
{"inputs": "Love makes you see a place differently, just as you hold differently an object that belongs to someone you love. If you know one landscape well, you will look at all other landscapes differently. And if you learn to love one place, sometimes you can also learn to love another."}
{"inputs": "Katniss: I’m coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta: (Gives an unconvincing shake of head.)Caesar: Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name? Peeta: Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.Caesar: She have another fellow? Peeta: I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her.Caesar: So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down, eh? Peeta: I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning… won’t help in my case.Caesar: Why ever not? Peeta: Because… because… she came here with me.Caesar: Oh, that is a piece of bad luck.Peeta: It’s not good.Caesar: Well, I don’t think any of us can blame you. It’d be hard not to fall for that young lady. She didn’t know? Peeta: Not until now."}
{"inputs": "Set the standard! Stop expecting others to show you love, acceptance, commitment, & respect when you don't even show that to yourself."}
{"inputs": "Dying is overrated. Human sentimentality has twisted it into the ultimate act of love. Biggest load of bullshit in the world. Dying for someone isn't the hard thing. The man that dies escapes. Plain and simple. Game over. End of pain...Try living for someone. Through it all-good, bad, thick, thin, joy, suffering. That's the hard thing."}
{"inputs": "Life is such unutterable hell, solely because it is sometimes beautiful. If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be."}
{"inputs": "He who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser, sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved, drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses."}
{"inputs": " Free love? As if love is anything but free! Man has bought brains, but all the millions in the world have failed to buy love. Man has subdued bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue love. Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love. Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly helpless before love. High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him by. And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant with warmth, with life and color. Thus love has the magic power to make of a beggar a king. Yes, love is free; it can dwell in no other atmosphere. In freedom it gives itself unreservedly, abundantly, completely. All the laws on the statutes, all the courts in the universe, cannot tear it from the soil, once love has taken root."}
{"inputs": "Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is soordinary that the whippers are in love too."}
{"inputs": "Adrian smiled and clasped my hands, taking a few steps toward me. And as for who you are, you’re the same beautiful, brave, and ridiculously smart caffeinated fighter you’ve been since the day I met you. Finally, he put beautiful at the top of his list of adjectives. Not that I should have cared.Sweet talker, I scoffed. You didn’t know anything about me the first time we met.I knew you were beautiful, he said. I just hoped for the rest."}
{"inputs": "We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes I think my whole life has been about holding on to you."}
{"inputs": "Don’t marry him. Don’t be with him. Be with me."}
{"inputs": "I guess the sacrifice of my dignity is the only thing that will save us now. The things I endure for love. The Fates laugh at my torment."}
{"inputs": "The only sea I saw Was the seesaw sea With you riding on it. Lie down, lie easy. Let me shipwreck in your thighs."}
{"inputs": "Love moderately. Long love doth so.Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.*Love each other in moderation. That is the key to long-lasting love. Too fast is as bad as too slow.*"}
{"inputs": "It's not at all hard to understand a person it's only hard to listen without bias."}
{"inputs": "Kids chase the love that eludes them."}
{"inputs": "Two separate beings, in different circumstances, face to face in freedom and seeking justification of their existence through one another, will always live an adventure full of risk and promise. (p. 248)"}
{"inputs": "How far have you walked for men who’ve never held your feet in their laps? "}
{"inputs": "He loved her for being so beautiful, and he hated her for it. He loved how she put shiny stuff on her lips for him, and he also reviled her for it. He wanted her to walk home alone, and he wanted to run after her and grab her up before she could take another step."}
{"inputs": "The surest way to hurt yourself is to give up on love, just because it didn’twork out the first time."}
{"inputs": "For the first time in forever, he was stunned to silence. Not by her words, but by the tenderness in her hands, the worry in her eyes. He was an archangel. He’d been wounded far, far worse and shrugged it off. But then, there had been no woman with sun kissed by the sunset and eyes of storm gray to tear into him for daring to get himself hurt."}
{"inputs": "What made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down, but of settling down permanently in something ugly."}
{"inputs": "She blushed and so did he. She greeted him in a faltering voice, and he spoke to her without knowing what he was saying."}
{"inputs": "Do you ever just put your arms out and just spin and spin and spin? Well, that's what love is like; everything inside of you tells you to stop before you fall, but for some reason you just keep going."}
{"inputs": "No one has imagined us. We want to live like trees, sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air, dappled with scars, still exuberantly budding, our animal passion rooted in the city."}
{"inputs": "I felt overwhelmed. I didn’t expect a first kiss to be so…life altering. In a few brief moments, the rule book of my universe had been rewritten. Suddenly I was a brand new person. I was as fragile as a newborn, but instead of the doctor placing me in my mother’s arms, he’d put me in Ren’s. What would Ren do with me? Would he draw me near, soothe me, and teach me about this new world or would he reject me and tell the doctor there must be some mistake. There was no way to know. What a breakable and delicate thing a heart was, no wonder I’d kept mine locked away."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes I turn around and catch the smell of you and I cannot go on I cannot fucking go on without expressing this terrible so fucking awful physical aching fucking longing I have for you. And I cannot believe that I can feel this for you and you feel nothing. Do you feel nothing? "}
{"inputs": "Look, I said, We knew Jason and Becky would be back, the break would end. This isn't a surprise, it's what's supposed to happen. It's what we wanted. Right? Is it? he asked. Is it what you want? Whether he intended it to be or not, this was the final question, the last Truth. If I said what I really thought, I was opening myself up for a hurt bigger than I could even imagine. I didn't have it in me.

{"inputs": "I don't care a damn about men who are loyal to the people who pay them, to organizations...I don't think even my country means all that much. There are many countries in our blood, aren't there, but only one person. Would the world be in the mess it is if we were loyal to love and not to countries? "}

{"inputs": "And there is my payment the rubies in your cheeks. Are you properly scandalized by your wicked behavior? If you were Catholic, you'd singe the ears of the priest you confessed to. Do you remember making me swear to repeat all those naughty actions agian, no matter what you said this morning? Now that he brought it up, I did recall saying that. Great Betrayed by my own immorality. God, Bones...some of that was depraved. I'll take that as a compliment. He closed the distance between us. I love you. Don't be ashamed of anything we did, even if your prudery is on life support."}
{"inputs": "I believe this. When we meet those we fall in love with, there is an aspect of our spirit that is historian, a bit of a pedant who reminisces or remembers a meeting when the other has passed by innocently…but all parts of the body must be ready for the other, all atoms must jump in one direction for desire to occur."}

{"inputs": "Friendship arises out of mere Companionship when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste which the others do not share and which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure (or burden). The typical expression of opening Friendship would be something like, What? You too? I thought I was the only one. ... It is when two such persons discover one another, when, whether with immense difficulties and semi-articulate fumblings or with what would seem to us amazing and elliptical speed, they share their vision - it is then that Friendship is born. And instantly they stand together in an immense solitude."}

Ruby: Fixing what you fucked up in your 40s.Rosie: Great. Looking forward to it."}
{"inputs": "I want to love you without clutching, appreciate you without judging, join you without invading, invite you without demanding, leave you without guilt, criticize you without blaming, and help you without insulting. If I can have the same from you, then we can truly meet and enrich each other."}
{"inputs": "The practice of love offers no place of safety. We risk loss, hurt, pain. We risk being acted upon by forces outside our control."}
{"inputs": "I believe that love--not imitation--is the sincerest form of flattery. Your imitator thinks that you can be duplicated your lover knows you can't."}
{"inputs": "Why me? she asked, holding on to him. Because you cared, he whispered. You cared so much for your people, it broke your heart to see the pack in ruins.

{"inputs": "And sometimes I believe your relentless analysis of June leaves something out, which is your feeling for her beyond knowledge, or in spite of knowledge. I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.What will you do after you have revealed all there is to know about June? Truth. What ferocity in your quest of it. You destroy and you suffer. In some strange way I am not with you, I am against you. We are destined to hold two truths. I love you and I fight you. And you, the same. We will be stronger for it, each of us, stronger with our love and our hate. When you caricature and nail down and tear apart, I hate you. I want to answer you, not with weak or stupid poetry but with a wonder as strong as your reality. I want to fight your surgical knife with all the occult and magical forces of the world."}

{"inputs": "Real love finds you once, if you're lucky."}
{"inputs": "He studied my appearance carefully. You cut your hair. Yes. Do you like it? That depends. How long is it? I pulled a curl down and showed him it ended just past my shoulder. He grunted, That’s still long enough, so I like it. Long enough for what? Long enough for a man to run his hands through."}
{"inputs": "In love, as in life, one misheard word can be tremendously important. If you tell someone you love them, for instance, you must be absolutely certain that they have replied I love you back and not I love your back before you continue the conversation."}
{"inputs": "You know I love you right? I know, he breathed, his arm tightening automatically around my waist. You know how much I wish it was enough."}
{"inputs": "Value your parabatai, he said. For it is a precious bond. All love is precious. It is why we do what we do. Why do we fight demons? Why are they not fit custodians of this world? What makes us better? It is because they do not build, but destroy. They do not love, but hate only. We are human and fallible, we Shadowhunters. But if we did not have the capability to love, we could not guard humans; we must love to guard them. My parabatai, he loved like few ever could love, with all and everything.

{"inputs": "I pray you, do not fall in love with me, for I am falser than vows made in wine."}
{"inputs": "I love you, I thought. But I didn’t say it. It was not that I feared she would laugh in my face. She was far too kind for that. My fear was a greater one— that she won’t say it back."}
{"inputs": "It’s all about falling in love with yourself and sharing that love with someone who appreciates you, rather than looking for love to compensate for a self love deficit."}

{"inputs": "Day leans in toward me. He reaches up to touch my face. I can tell it still hurts him to use his fingers, and his nails are dark with dried blood. You're brilliant, he says. But you're a fool to stay wish someone like me. I close my eyes at the touch of his hand. Then we're both fools."}
{"inputs": "Maybe we shouldn't be looking for love. Maybe we should be looking for a person. Because maybe you can find love in a person, but not have that person. So if you look for love, what you will find is love. But if you want to belong to someone, and you want someone to belong to you, you should look for a person."}

{"inputs": "Denna is a wild thing, I explained. Like a hind or a summer storm. If a storm blows down your house, or breaks a tree, you don't say the storm was mean. It was cruel. It acted according to its nature and something unfortunately was hurt. The same is true of Denna."}

{"inputs": "It's clear to me now that I have been moving toward you and you toward me for a long time. Though neither of us was aware of the other before we met, there was a kind of mindless certainty bumming blithely along beneath our ignorance that ensured we would come together. Like two solitary birds flying the great prairies by celestial reckoning, all of these years and lifetimes we have been moving toward one another."}
{"inputs": "Maybe you expected marriage to be perfect - I guess that's where you and I are different. See, I thought it would be all about making mistakes, but doing it with someone who's there to remind you what you learned along the way."}

{"inputs": "When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep.And When his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.And When he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden...But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out oflove’s threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears...But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully."}
{"inputs": "I can hate you more, but I'll never love you less."}
{"inputs": "Time is how you spend your love."}
{"inputs": "Falling in love was like falling off a cliff. It felt pretty much like flying until you hit the ground."}
{"inputs": "Wow. I didn’t think it was possible for him to look any more intoxicating than he already did. But a leather clad Ren standing next to the gorgeous racing motorcycle holding his helmet made my brain go numb. I had kind of a this-is-your-brain-on-drugs moment, only mine was more like a this-is-your-brain-on-seeing-Ren-in-tight-leather moment. If they’d been smart, the Ducati Company should have used him in a commercial and given him the bike for free."}

{"inputs": "You don't need another Human Being to make your life complete, but let's be honest. Having your wounds kissed by someone who doesn't see them as disasters In your soul, but cracks to put their love into, Is the most calming thing In this World."}
{"inputs": "For there are two kinds of forgiveness in the world: the one you practice because everything really is all right, and what went before is mended. The other kind of forgiveness you practice because someone needs desperately to be forgiven, or because you need just as badly to forgive them, for a heart can grab hold of old wounds and go sour as milk over them."}
{"inputs": "The most difficult aspect of moving on is accepting that the other person already did."}

{"inputs": "When all is said and done, the weather and love are the two elements about which one can never be sure."}
{"inputs": "I loved you long before you loved me. It's the only thing I have you beat at, and I'll bring it up every chance I get."}
{"inputs": "You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature."}
{"inputs": "Part of falling in love with someone is actually falling in love with yourself. Realizing that you're gorgeous, you're fearless and unpredictable, you're a firecracker spitting light, entrancing a hundred faces that stare up at you with starry eyes."}
{"inputs": "You know, he said, under normal circumstances, you inviting me to the bedroom would be the highlight of my day. I jumped up."}
{"inputs": "Time expands, then contracts, all in tune with the stirrings of the heart."}
{"inputs": "It's the most wonderful and terrible thing that can ever happen to you, she said simply.

{"inputs": "Fear can’t be reasoned with. Neither can hate. They’re like love. They’re almost identical emotions. That’s why Ares and Aphrodite like each other. Their twin sons – Fear and Panic – were spawned from both war and love."}
{"inputs": "Love should be treated like a business deal, but every business deal has its own terms and its own currency. And in love, the currency is virtue. You love people not for what you do for them or what they do for you. You love them for the values, the virtues, which they have achieved in their own character."}
{"inputs": "Love is making friends with fear because fear is the constant companion of intimacy ~ and when you bring fear out of the darkness and into the light, you realize it was an illusion based on our own insecurities."}

{"inputs": "Love is the kind of thing that's already happening by the time you notice it, that's how it works, and no matter how old you get, that doesn't change. Except that you can break it up into two entirely distinct types -- love where there's an end in sight and love where there isn't."}
{"inputs": "That this girl would know exactly how to shatter me."}
{"inputs": "Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand, and what you've been up there searching for forever, is in your hands. When you figure out love is all that matters after all it sure makes everything else seem so small."}

{"inputs": "You’re sorry? I damn near drank myself to death, I could barely get out of bed, I shattered my phone into a million pieces on New Year’s Eve to keep from calling you … and you’re sorry? I bit my lip and nodded, ashamed. I had no idea what he’d been through, and hearing his say the words made sharp pain twist inside my chest. I’m so … so sorry.You’re forgiven, he said with a grin. Don’t ever do it again.I won’t. I promise.He flashed his dimple and shook his head. I fucking love you."}
{"inputs": "I know women are taught by other women that they must never admit the full truth to a man. But the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. Not being men, these women don't know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with, a man's heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct. The better class of man, even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying, is not retained by them. A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her that, sooner or later, her old admirers feel; under which they allow her to go unlamented to her grave."}

{"inputs": "What is it the I'll want from you? Not love: that would be too much to ask. Not forgiveness, which isn't yours to bestow. Only a listener, perhaps; only someone who will see me. Don't prettify me though, whatever else you do: I have no wish to be a decorated skull. But I leave myself in your hands. What choice do I have? By the time you read this last page, that- if anywhere- is the only place I will be."}

I've seen you out there every day for the past week, and everyone knows you stare at me all day in school, if you have something you want to say to me why don't you just say it to my face instead of sneaking around like a crook? I considered my options. Either I could run away and never go back to school again, maybe even leave the country as a stowaway on a ship bound for Australia. Or I could risk everything and confess to her. The answer was obvious: I was going to Australia. I opened my mouth to say goodbye forever. And yet. What I said was: I want to know if you'll marry me."}
{"inputs": "You must learn to forgive a man when he's in love. He's always a nuisance."}

{"inputs": "Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply to make love in a field of violets."}
{"inputs": "You said, 'I love you.' Why is it that the most unoriginal thing we can say to one another is still the thing we long to hear? 'I love you' is always a quotation. You did not say it first and neither did I, yet when you say it and when I say it we speak like savages who have found three words and worship them."}
{"inputs": "This is the true measure of love: when we believe that we alone can love, that no one could ever have loved so before us, and that no one will ever love in the same way after us."}
{"inputs": "In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart."}
{"inputs": "Visionary feminism is a wise and loving politics. It is rooted in the love of male and female being, refusing to privilege one over the other. The soul of feminist politics is the commitment to ending patriarchal domination of women and men, girls and boys. Love cannot exist in any relationship that is based on domination and coercion. Males cannot love themselves in patriarchal culture if their very self-definition relies on submission to patriarchal rules. When men embrace feminist thinking and preactice, which emphasizes the value of mutual growth and self-actualization in all relationships, their emotional well-being will be enhanced. A genuine feminist politics always brings us from bondage to freedom, from lovelessness to loving."}
{"inputs": "Marveling at his own boldness, he said softly, I would enter your sleep if I could, and guard you there, and slay the thing that hounds you, as I would if it had the courage to face me in fair daylight. But I cannot come in unless you dream of me."}

{"inputs": "Parents have this twisted belief that anyone under the age of about twenty simply can’t know what love is, like the age to love is assessed in the same way the law assesses the legal age to drink. They think that the ‘emotional growth’ of a teenager’s mind is too underdeveloped to understand love, to know if it’s ‘real’ or not.That's completely asinine. way."}
{"inputs": "It´s natural to want someone you love to do what you want, or what you think would be good for them, but you have to let everything happen to them.

{"inputs": "My love affair with (him) had a wonderful element of romance to it, which I will always cherish. But it was not an infatuation, and here’s how I can tell: because I did not demand that he become my Great Emancipator or my Source of All Life, nor did I immediately vanish into that man’s chest cavity like a twisted, unrecognizable, parasitical homonculus. During our long period of courtship, I remained intact within my own personality, and I allowed myself to meet (him) for who he was."}

{"inputs": "When you have reached the point where you no longer expect a response, you will at last be able to give in such a way that the other is able to receive, and be grateful. When Love has matured and, through a dissolution of the self into light, become a radiance, then shall the Lover be liberated from dependence upon the Beloved, and the Beloved also be made perfect by being liberated from the Lover."}
{"inputs": "He didn't look like the same person who picked me up this morning. Noah--sarcastic, distant, untouchable Noah--cared. And that made him real."}
{"inputs": "The worst thing: to give yourself away in exchange for not enough love."}
{"inputs": "Was it all in my head? A Lunar trick? Her stomach twisted. No. She shook her head, fervently. How to explain that she hadn’t had the gift before? That she couldn’t have used it against him? I would never lie—The words faded. She had lied. Everything he knew about her had been a lie.I’m so sorry, she finished, the words falling lamely in the open air.Kai peeled his eyes away, finding some place of resignation off in the glistening garden. You’re even more painful to look at than she is."}

{"inputs": "True friends will always push you towards the great possibilities of your future, false friends will always chain you to the mistakes in your past."}
{"inputs": "The Eskimo has fifty-names for snow because it is important to them there ought to be as many for love. "}
{"inputs": "I mean, I hope you're happy, But the sky is still the sky without you, And I'm not surprised by that anymore."}
{"inputs": "There are betrayals in war that are childlike compared with our human betrayals during peace. The new lovers enter the habits of the other. Things are smashed, revealed in a new light. This is done with nervous or tender sentences, although the heart is an organ of fire."}
{"inputs": "Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance."}
{"inputs": "We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness insidethat holds whatever we want.We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner spacethat makes it livable.We work with being, but non-being is what we use."}
{"inputs": "I love you every day. And now I will miss you every day."}
{"inputs": "If you follow the will of God, you know that in spite of all the terrible things that happen to you, you will never lose a final refuge. You know that the foundation of the world is love, so that even when no human being can or will help you, you may go on, trusting in the One that loves you."}
{"inputs": "Love demands expression. It will not stay still, stay silent, be good, be modest, be seen and not heard, no. It will break out in tongues of praise, the high note that smashes the glass and spills the liquid."}
{"inputs": "To long a sacrifice can make a stone of a heart"}
{"inputs": "Ten long trips around the sun since I last saw that smile, but only joy and thankfulness that on a tiny world in the vastness, for a couple of moments in the immensity of time, we were one."}
{"inputs": "It wasn't a thing I had consciously missed, but having it now reminded me of the joy of it; that drowsy intimacy in which a man's body is accessible to you as your own, the strange shapes and textures of it like a sudden extension of your own limbs."}
{"inputs": "Love is bullshit. Emotion is bullshit. I am a rock. A jerk. I'm an uncaring asshole and proud of it."}
{"inputs": "Darkness may hide the treesand the flowers from the eyesbut it cannot hidelove from the soul."}
{"inputs": "You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation...and that is called loving. Well, then, love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is your aversion that hurts, nothing else."}
{"inputs": "I felt his other hand sear hot against my cheek. He bent his head, and in a voice that Jack couldn’t hear, said, When you came down the stairs, and fell into me, that was the moment. Then his lips pressed against mine."}
{"inputs": "Your salary is not love and your word is not love. Your clothes are not love and holding hands is not love. Sex is not love and a kiss is not love. Long letters are not love and a text is not love. Flowers are not love and a box of chocolates is not love. Sunsets are not love and photographs are not love. The stars are not love and a beach under the moonlight is not love. The smell of someone else on your pillow is not love and the feeling of their skin touching your skin is not love. Heart-shaped candy is not love and an overseas holiday is not love. The truth is not love and winning an argument is not love. Warm coffee isn't love and cheap cards bought from stores are not love. Tears are not love and laughter is not love. A head on a shoulder is not love and messages written at the front of books given as gifts are not love. Apathy is not love and numbness is not love. A pain in your chest is not love and clenching your fist is not love. Rain is not love.Only you. Only you, are love."}
{"inputs": "I'm afraid they're in love, he said, concerned. They don't want to leave you. He lifted one hand from her waist to gently brush a pair from her neck, where their wings fanned against her jaw. Melancholy, he said, I know just how they feel."}
{"inputs": "You don't fall in love with someone because it's convenient."}
{"inputs": "Nico studied his face – his sea-green eyes, his grin, his ruffled black hair. Somehow Percy Jackson seemed like a regular guy now, not a mythical figure. Not someone to idolize or crush on."}
{"inputs": "What I was trying to say, he whispered, is that I see you in everything. There isn’t a word for you that means enough, because you’re everything to me."}
{"inputs": "In the slaughterhouse of love, they kill only the best, none of the weak or deformed. Don't run away from this dying. Whoever's not killed for love is dead meat."}
{"inputs": "Things could change, Gabe, Jonas went on. Things could be different. I don't know how, but there must be some way for things to be different. There could be colors. And grandparents, he added, staring through the dimness toward the ceiling of his sleepingroom. And everybody would have the memories. You know the memories, he whispered, turning toward the crib.Garbriel's breathing was even and deep. Jonas liked having him there, though he felt guilty about the secret. Each night he gave memories to Gabriel: memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun; memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of dancing barefoot on a damp lawn. Gabe? The newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. Jonas looked over at him. There could be love, Jonas whispered."}
{"inputs": "You'd be surprised what people will do for money that they wouldn't do forlove.Myrnin."}
{"inputs": "Hmm…now that I think about it, housecats are often coddled and petted. You don’t pet me nearly enough. You must be a lax owner. How selfish of you to deprive your cat of attention."}
{"inputs": "She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her..."}
{"inputs": "I love you more than songs can say, but I can't keep running after yesterday..."}
{"inputs": "I love Jere more than anybody. He’s my brother, my family. I hate myself for doing this. But when I see you two together, I hate him too. His voice broke.Don’t marry him. Don’t be with him. Be with me."}
{"inputs": "It’s impossible, he snapped. Why? Because I’m Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent. I can’t be celibate. Everyone knows that."}
{"inputs": "Right then, I wanted to go back in time and relive every moment with him. One more secret smile, one more shared laugh. One more electric kiss. Finding him was like finding someone I didn't know I was searching for. He’d come into my life too late, and now was leaving too soon. I remembered him telling me he’d give up everything for me. He already had."}
{"inputs": "God is love, she said. And he respects love, whether it's between a parents, and child, a man and woman, or friends. I don't think he cares about religion one little bit. Live your life right. Love with all your heart. Don't hurt others, and help those in need. That is all you need to know. And don't worry about heaven. If it exists, you'll be welcome."}
{"inputs": "...no woman can love a weak man hard enough to make him strong."}
{"inputs": "You don't need to justify your love, you don't need to explain your love, you just need to practice your love. Practice creates the master."}
{"inputs": "A girl can wait for the right man to come along but in the meantime that doesn't mean she can't have a wonderful time with all the wrong ones"}
{"inputs": "... it’s a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return."}
{"inputs": "The sun's gone dim, and the moon's gone black. For I loved him, and he didn't love back."}
{"inputs": "She puts her hands on either side of my face, and the room falls away. I have never gotten so lost in a kiss before. And then, the space between us explodes. My heart keeps missing beats and my hands cannot bring her close enough to me. I taste her and realize I have been starving. I have loved before, but it didn't feel like this.I have kissed before, but it didn't burn me alive. Maybe it lasts a minute, and maybe it's an hour. All I know is that kiss, and how soft her skin is when it brushes against mine, and that even if I did not know it until now, I have been waiting for this person forever."}
{"inputs": "A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else."}
{"inputs": "... i didn't fall in love of courseit's never up to you but she was walking back and forthand i was passing through"}
{"inputs": "Now, as we stand three feet apart and stare at each other, I feel the full distance that comes with spending so much time apart, a moment filled with the electricity of a first meeting and the uncertainty of strangers."}
{"inputs": "Happiness is the china shop love is the bull. "}
{"inputs": "For men, I think, love is a thing formed of equal parts lust and astonishment. The astonishment part women understand. The lust part they only think they understand."}
{"inputs": "Ronan's second secret was Adam Parrish."}
{"inputs": "When a man finds the woman he really loves, the one he respects and wants to call wife, there is nothing on earth he won't do for her. No mountain he won't hike. No river he won't wade. No door he won't open. She is Eve and there's not a snake crawling that can keep them apart."}
{"inputs": "It's funny. No matter how hard you try, you can't close your heart forever. And the minute you open it up, you never know what's going to come in. But when it does, you just have to go for it! Because if you don't, there's not point in being here."}
{"inputs": "If I love you, is that a fact or a weapon? "}
{"inputs": "Gilbert, I'm afraid I'm scandalously in love with you."}
{"inputs": "Clary shut her eyes. You didn't say no to an angel, no matter what it had in mind. Her heart pounding, she sat floating in the darkness behind her eyelids, resolutely trying not to think of Jace. But his face appear against the blank screen of her closed eyelids anyway - not smiling at her but looking sidelong, and she could see the scar at his temple, the uneven curl at the corner of his mouth, and the silver line on his throat where Simon had bitten him - all the marks and flaws and imperfections that made up the person she loved most in the world. Jace. A bright light lit her vision to scarlet, and she fell back against the sand, wondering if she was going to pass out - or maybe she was dying - but she didn't want to die, not now that she could see Jace's face so clearly in front of her. She could almost hear his voice, too, saying her name, the way he'd whispered it at Renwick's, over and over again. Clary. Clary. Clary. Clary, Jace said. Open your eyes."}
{"inputs": "Think of it! We could have gone on longing for one another and pretending not to notice forever. This obsession with dignity can ruin your life if you let it."}
{"inputs": "Do you think we can be friends? I asked.He stared up at the ceiling. Probably not, but we can pretend."}
{"inputs": "The fact that Ridge has been honest in his conversations with me is not something he did wrong. The fact that he has feelings for me also isn’t wrong, when you know exactly how much he’s fought those feelings. People can’t control matters of the heart, Warren. They can only control their actions, which is exactly what Ridge did. He lost control once for ten seconds, but after that, every single time temptation reared its ugly head, he walked in the other direction. The only thing Ridge has done wrong is fail to delete his messages, because by doing so, he failed to protect Maggie. He failed to protect her from the harsh truth that people don’t get to choose who they fall in love with. They only get to choose who they stay in love with. I look up at the ceiling and blink back tears. He was choosing to stay in love with her, Warren. Why can’t she see that? This will kill him so much more than it’s killing her."}
{"inputs": "Never fall in love? Always, said the count. I am always in love."}
{"inputs": "When love first happens, the individuals are giving each other energy unconsciously and both people feel buoyant and elated. That's the incredible high we call being ‘in love.’ Unfortunately, once they expect this feeling to come from another person, they cut themselves off from the energy in the universe and begin to rely even more on the energy from each other--only now there doesn’t seem to be enough and so they stop giving each other energy and fall back into their dramas in an attempt to control each other and force the other’s energy their way."}
{"inputs": "For Beatrice, when we first met, I was lonely, and you were pretty. Now I am pretty lonely."}
{"inputs": "The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: 'If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me? ' But...the good Samaritan reversed the question: 'If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him? "}
{"inputs": "This is what I know. Don't settle for 40, 50, or even 80 percent. A relationship-it shouldn't be too small or too tight or even a little scratchy. It shouldn't take up space in your closet out of guilty conscience or convenience or a moment of desire. Do you hear me? It should be perfect for you. It should be lasting. Wait. wait for 100 percent."}
{"inputs": "Time has no meaning, Love will endure.."}
{"inputs": "If people did not love one another, I really don't see what use there would be in having any spring."}
{"inputs": "I am yours. Don't give myself back to me."}
{"inputs": "Love at first sight is easy to understand"}
{"inputs": "Marriage is not a process for prolonging the life of love, sir. It merely mummifies its corpse."}
{"inputs": "I wanted to see the place where Margaret grew to what she is, even at the worst time of all, when I had no hope of ever calling her mine."}
{"inputs": "And I still love you in my own fucked-up way. I miss you, I really do. Can we still be friends? "}
{"inputs": "He shakes his head, and he's saying something, and I think I might kiss him. Because I've never kissed anyone before. (I was afraid I might bite.) And I've never wanted to kiss anyone but him. (I won't bite. I won't hurt him.) I just want to kiss him, then go. Simon..., I say. And then he kisses me."}
{"inputs": "One loves truly only once in a lifetime, Julian, even if one isn’t aware of it."}
{"inputs": "You know, when it works, love is amazing. It's not overrated."}
